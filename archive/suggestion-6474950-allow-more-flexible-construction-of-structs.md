in F# it is not possible to have a constructor for a struct that sets only some fields. For structs that have an expicit field layout (low level discriminating unions so to say) this is very prohibiting.
c#
struct Point
{
private readonly int _x;
private readonly int _y;
public Point(int x) : this() // Will set _y = 0, make this possible in fä
{
_x = x;
}
}
f#
type Point =
struct
val X: float
val Y: float
new(x: float, y: float) = { X = x; Y = y }
new(x: float) = ? // how to call this() or new() here? <<<<<<<<======
end

Thanks for the suggestion! I’ve added links to how you can do this. Declining per my comments
