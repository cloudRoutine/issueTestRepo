This is an alternative to: [/archive/suggestion-15257796-remove-warning-for-new-keyword-on-idisposable](/archive/suggestion-15257796-remove-warning-for-new-keyword-on-idisposable.md)
The idea is that the new keyword provides valuable information, but only if you do not use it on all types.
When avoiding its usage, you get a visual clue as to instances of disposable types, as well as warnings if you bind them.
By making it a warning to use new unnecessarily, the compiler would effectively enforce a "best practice" with regards to IDisposable usage. It goes a long way today, but requires discipline to make it useful.
This would be especially helpful to people coming to F# from C#, as many immediately use new everywhere, and don't see this very nice safety benefit provided by the compiler.
