I suggest we consider allowing ExtensionProperty=expr property setters in initializers.
For example
C(ExtensionProperty = [1;2;3])
Or for example to provide c# “add” pattern like support
type StackLayout with
member x.ChildrenInitializer with set (values : UIElement seq)=
values |> Seq.iter x.Children.Add
let layout = StackLayout (Orientation = StackOrientation.Horizonta,
ChildrenInitializer = [Entry(Placeholder = “Username”);Entry()])

This has now been completed for F# 4.0+, see https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/17 and https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/blob/master/FSharp-4.0/ExtensionPropertyInitializersDesignAndSpec.md

I very much like this proposal, especially as i comes with a trial implementation that appears sound on a quick review.
However, it would be great to get more eyes on this and get more votes for the featue. If you are on twitter, could you advocate for this feature using the #fsharp tag please.

Hi Paul,
There's a problem with your submission, could you take a look? Also you will need to sign the CLA for submitting to http://visualfsharp.codeplex.com
Otherwise I think it's ready to go.
Thanks
Don
