You currently can't "open" a static class e.g. System.Console - only modules or namespaces. We should be able to also open static classes as well.

Thanks for the suggestion. Approved in principle.
We will open an RFC for this in due course https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/tree/master/RFCs

I agree. Modules are compiled down to static classes anyway, so there should be no technical reason for disallowing it.

Yes, this should I suppose be implemented to match the corresponding C# feature, since static classes will begin to be more common coming from the C# world.

As in C#, static classes defined in F# will probably become more common. If so, would we still require static classes in F# to be defined via [<AbstractClass; Sealed>]? Or, would it make sense to reuse the static keyword known from 'static member' for 'static type'?
