With SqlEnumProvider, unless I create a CLIEnum, the provided type is a module with members of the value's type (e.g. string).
It would be nice to be able to provide a type alias for the members that would be visible from other parts of the program to make clear the association with the provided type (e.g. provided type is named "EmployeeCodes", and the members are strings with aliased type "EmployeeCode").

Closing because this is already possible today in F# 3.0 and beyond, per my comment below
Thanks for the suggestion.

I believe this is actually possible today, though the ProvidedTypes SDK may need updating. Specifically you just have to create a ProvidedSymbolType with the right name and kind. For example
ProvidedSymbolType(ProvidedSymbolKind.FSharpTypeAbbreviation(typeAssembly,typeNamespace, typeName), [])
Certainly the core ITypeProvider mechanism supports this.
I will close this and we can follow up with an issue in https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.TypeProviders.StarterPack/
