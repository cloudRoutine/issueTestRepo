One of the biggest problem in async or computation expressions in general is lack of proper stacktraces when exceptions are raised. This is a major annoyance when debugging in the large, often leading to errors whose origin cannot be traced.
I recently made a blog post arguing for the addition of language features that would make symbolic stacktraces possible for computation expression authors: https://eiriktsarpalis.wordpress.com/2015/12/27/reconciling-stacktraces-with-computation-expressions/
Symbolic stacktraces is a feature that has already appeared in languages like C# (https://github.com/ljw1004/async-exception-stacktrace) and JavaScript (http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/async-call-stack/)

From a compiler perspective, I believe that the issue has been covered by RFC FS-1012..
