It turns out that using immutable algorithm is not always the best thing in regards to performance. An interesting story about this is http://viralfsharp.com/2015/12/27/look-and-say-f/
So mutable code can actually be better in regards to performance (because it involves less allocations?). So maybe, in the cases in which it can be assured that no race condition can happen (i.e. mutable locals instead of mutable fields, because the former cannot be shared between threads), the F# compiler should try to optimize the IL generated for methods, to mutable-locals-optimized IL.
An example of how Streams could be optimized: https://github.com/nessos/Streams

Iâ€™m marking this as declined since the proposal is not concrete enough. What specific design changes are proposed?
The Streams library is great, but can already be used from F#, as can most other mutable programming techniques.

Thanks for your reply Don, inline:
> What specific design changes are proposed?
My general wandering here is 'can what Nessos has accomplished, be completely automated at the IL-optimization level?'.
