The current reverse pipe (<|) is left-associative and same precedence.
Left-associativity is "unnatural" for reverse pipe making it's usage harder, ie this doesn't compile: let x = abs <| abs <| 2;
In addition sharing the precedence of |> makes mixing them harder.
There are already existing languages with such an operator ie Haskell and operator '$'.
I propose adding a right-associative low precedence reverse pipe operator to F# in order to improve reverse-piping.
I know some people disagree with reverse-piping but I personally like it as it can be used to remove parantheses. To me excessive amount of paratheses makes code harder to read (I guess this is the reason I struggle to enjoy LISP).

Thanks for the suggestion, though I’m declining per my comment below.
Many thanks,

For the interested I a PR as a proposal: https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/marten_range/visualfsharp/contribution/7074

This can always be added as an operator outside the core library.
I must admit I'm not a fan of encouraging the widespread use of reverse piping beyond a single "f <| x" It seems to me that reverse piping supporting a single function is reasonable but the other cases tend to code obscurity.
I will decline this since we don't plan to add such an operator to FSharp.Core, and because you can define an operator outside the core library in your own implementation code.
