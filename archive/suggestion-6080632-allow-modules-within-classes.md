I assumed I could declare modules within classes, and I tried to create one to organize values private to my class, and found that it was not allowed:
type MyView() =
module Colors =
let button = 0x0000FF
let label = 0xCCCCCC

let Button = new UIButton(BackgroundColor=Colors.button)

Declining this. Allowing nested type definitions ala C# would take priority, and nested modules would be considered as part of that feature.
