As explained in OCaml 4.02 release note: "The match construct was extended to discriminate not just on the value of its argument expression, but also on exceptions arising out of the evaluation of this expression. This solves an old problem: in a let x = a in b, catch exceptions raised by a but not those raised by b. "
