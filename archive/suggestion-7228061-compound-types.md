This is a feature present in Scala.
A compound type is an extension of flexible types that involves multiple type constraints on a type parameter. You specify compound types like this:
let example (a : 'a :> I1 & I2) = ...
let example (a :> I1 & I2) = ...
let example<'a when 'a :> I1 & I2>() = ...
These are similar to:
let example (a : 'a when 'a :> I1 and 'a :> I2) = ...
let example<'a when 'a :> I1 and 'a :> I2>() = ...
The & symbol is chosen not to conflict with the word 'and' when specifying multiple type constraints.

Syntactically I think it would be nice to use the word "and" instead of "&" since we already use "and" in the more verbose version.

@Jon Ludwig, yes I initially wanted to use the word 'and', but it makes things more difficult to parse, both for humans and for the compiler. E.g. consider `let example<'a, 'b when 'a :> I1 and I2 and 'b :> I2>. I think it should be possible to immediately distinguish between a compound type and another type constraint. Other options are 'a :> I1 I2 (just using a space), 'a :> I1+I2, 'a :> I1 with I2 (this is how it's written in Scala). I'm also hesitating of using the comma.

As a piece of history, we proposed a variation on compound types for C# and .NET many moons ago (in 1999) http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2012/07/05/more-c-net-generics-history-the-msr-white-paper-from-mid-1999.aspx :)
Do you want "I1 & I2" to be a first-class type?

I'm inclined to decline this. While I appreciate the logic of compound types it doesn't seem to add enough to the F# language design to do this, given the lack of votes here and the complexity it will inevitable bring.
