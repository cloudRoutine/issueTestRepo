It seems in some cases type directed conversion from functions to .Net Func<_,_> delegates only works if the called method has overloads. It would be convenient if it worked the same way for methods without overloads as well.
For example:
open System.Linq
let even n = n % 2 = 0
let seqA = seq { 0..2..10 }
seqA.Where(even) // works
seqA.All(even) // does not work

Workarounds:
seqA.All(System.Func<_,_>(even))
seqA.All(fun x -> even x)

This does work:
even |> seqA.all

Why not use the .NET native Action and Func and other delegates unstead of the only F# specific closure? Or at least, allow some implicit convertion here.
