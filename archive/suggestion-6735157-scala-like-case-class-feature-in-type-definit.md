I would like to have Scala like 'case class' feature in 'type' definition. In F# 3.0, type definition is too verbose

F# discriminated unions play this role

Could you please provide an example of syntax?
I think that F# Discriminated Unions are more elegant than Scala case classes http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233226.aspx

sealed abstract class DU
case class Case1(field1: Int, field2: String) extends DU
case class Case1(field3: List[DU]) extends DU
vs
type DU =
| Case1 of field1: int * field2: string
| Case1 of field3: DU list
So who is verbose now?
