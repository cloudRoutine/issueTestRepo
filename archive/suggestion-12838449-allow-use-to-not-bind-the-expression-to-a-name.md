In C#, one can use using(CreateSomeDisposable()) without binding the expression to a name.
Same construct in F# is not allowed, forcing a workaround such as
use __ = CreateSomeDisposable()
allow to make it like this:
use CreateSomeDisposable()

In my opinion the bigger annoyance is that a use expression can't even be bound to _ (single underscore), so if I want to use multiple uses, I need to write something like
use _1 = CreateSomeDisposable()
use _2 = CreateSomeDisposable()
If I could instead bind it to the wildcard character _, then I would be happy:
use _ = CreateSomeDisposable()
use _ = CreateSomeDisposable()
