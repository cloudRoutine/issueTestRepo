Async.Choice is super useful (e.g. very important in Paket) but hard to implement. There are couple of implementations floating around like http://www.fssnip.net/dO but it's ahrd to decide which one is correct. We should add it to the core.

Btw, the implementation of http://www.fssnip.net/dO is flawed. I would consider using http://www.fssnip.net/dN instead.

If I remember correctly that version didn't work in paket since it doesn't cancel running http requests
