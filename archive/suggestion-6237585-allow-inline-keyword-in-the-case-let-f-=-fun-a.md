### Status : planned

Currently, the code "let inline f = fun a -> ..." does not compile, but the code "let inline f a = ..." does compile. Since the two mean the same thing, "inline" should be allowed on both.

This is approved for inclusion in a future release of F# subject to completion of an RFC and implementation.
An RFC can be submitted to https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/tree/master/RFCs
A pull request to implement this feature will be necessary and we encourage contributors to submit one with adequate design detail and testing to http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp.
Discussion of the particular version for this to be included in can be made once an implementation is available.

Posted an issue on the fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service repository over on GitHub here:
https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service/issues/315
Don Syme suggested either moving it to the Microsoft/VisualFSharp repository as a bug or posting it as a feature request here, and seeing as it's already mentioned here, I'll tag along for the ride.
Adding my +3 for the time-being :)

I have the exact same problem (also inspired by your suggestion in the comments on Haskell-style type annotations).
I feel that this is a bug - not a feature request - because it is valid syntax and compiles to exactly the same code as the more standard 'let inline f a = ...'.

I've also posted this as a bug on https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/467

This is not something I see as a priority (because there is an adequate way of working around the problem), but a pull request (with adequate testing etc.) that implements this could well be accepted, assuming no gotchas are found along the way.

I'm changing this to be marked as "approved". This means someone can propose a PR for the issue. PRs should be submitted to http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp.
