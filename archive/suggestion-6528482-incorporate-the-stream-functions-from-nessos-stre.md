Efficient functional-style pipelines on streams of data. The main design behind Streams is inspired by Java 8 Streams and is based on the observation that many functional pipelines follow the pattern
source/generator |> lazy |> lazy |> lazy |> eager/reduce
Source/generator are functions that create Streams like Stream.ofArray/Stream.init.
Lazy functions take in streams and return streams like Stream.map/Stream.filter, these operations are fused together for efficient iteration.
Eager/reduce are functions like Stream.iter/Stream.sum that force the Stream to evaluate up to that point.

Declining this because AFAIK Stream can’t be used as a replacement for Seq without either some semantic or performance changes. I think it is better we promote the use of Stream as a high-quality add-on library and continue to improve it.
More comments and input welcome though – perhaps Java 8 will gradually lead people to expect this in the core. But equally we have to be training people to select from available extra libraries.

I'm making the perhaps Naive assumption that replacing the current Core.Collections module functions with their Streams equivalents is technically feasible. This may potentially be a breaking change for some users. There is nothing preventing you from putting a side effect into the Map function, for instance. Some behavior of that side effect could change. Therefore from the point of view of semantic versioning, F# 4.0 is the right time to do this.

Stream has different design center than Seq but they are complementary. Seq is based on a pull model (external iteration) and Stream is based on a push model (internal iteration). As an example Seq.zip cannot be implemented in Stream as an "intermediate" combinator but it can be implemented as a producer.

I don't think just replacing Seq by Stream is possible (Nick, tell me if I'm wrong), so it's unlikely we'll bring this into FSharp.Core. However I strongly encourage the use of the Nessos Stream library where appropriate.
