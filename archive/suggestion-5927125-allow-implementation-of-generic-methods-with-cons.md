Currently this is solved as 'a = 'b.
This limitation does not exists in C# and it makes impossible to interact with some existing libraries, as in this case http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23643989/is-it-possible-to-implement-the-idbsett-interface-in-f
This will also allow to work around F#'s lack of generic (co/contra)-variance.

Could Don Syme or someone from the F# team comment on whether this can be realized?

Maybe you can tweet him with this. But completed features have a very low vote count generally: https://fslang.uservoice.com/forums/245727-f-language/status/1225916. Possibly suggested by the core team.

What makes you think they were suggested by the core team? You can see the names of people that have raised each of the completed features.
