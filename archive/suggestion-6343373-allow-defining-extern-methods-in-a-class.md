Currently it appears that extern methods for platform invoke only work properly when used inside of a module (see this discussion: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22275072/why-does-the-f-compiler-give-an-error-for-one-case-but-not-the-other) this limitation poses problems when organizing your code in an efficient manner and results in having multiple modules defined (for an example, see here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25004314/working-with-safehandles-in-f)
It would be nice if extern methods could be defined in classes (and work correctly) even if the scope of the method is always limited to the type itself.

This is now “approved in principle” for some version of F# 4.x or beyond. It is entirely reasonable to eventually allow this for F#.
However, because there is a workaround (using a module), and because the implementation and testing is a little complicated, involving new code paths, it may be that the feature is not seen as high priority. Only a fully implemented and tested feature would be accepted.
Implementations of approved language design items can now be submitted as pull requests to the appropriate branch of http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp. See http://fsharp.github.io/2014/06/18/fsharp-contributions.html for information on contributing to the F# language and core library.
