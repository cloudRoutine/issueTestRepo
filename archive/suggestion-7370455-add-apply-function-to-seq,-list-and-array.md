Simply a function a la
let apply (mapping: 'T -> 'U) (source: seq<'T>) : seq<'T * 'U> = source |> Seq.map (fun x -> (x, mapping x))
This would for instance be useful when creating graphs like
[0. .. 0.01 .. 1.] |> Seq.apply sin |> plot

I feel this is more a convenience function than something to have in the core. Also, is
[ for x in 0 .. 0.01 .. 1.0 -> (x,sin x) ]
too much?
Cheers
