CLR has native support for union types; these could provide optimization and performance opportunities for F# discriminated unions.

Would love to know why this wasnt done in the initial implementation.

Also interested. Does anyone have more information on native union types in the CLR?

When you say "native support for union types" do you mean the usage of attributes <StructLayout( LayoutKind.Explicit )> or something else?
I currently have a need for a DU type that is not heap allocated - this is causing performance problems via the "JIT_new" operation being expensive.

It would be good to have some mock-up code with performance comparisons for this.

A proof of concept explicit structlayout based demo available at:
https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/620
https://gist.github.com/zpodlovics/80e12e2de35cf73e6e03
However, it limited only to blittable types. Combine it with blittable type constraint and you can have stack allocated DU.
