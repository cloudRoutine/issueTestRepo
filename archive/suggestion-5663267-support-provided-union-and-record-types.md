Marking as “approved in principle” (it will show as “planned”).
However, in reality it is both relatively low priority and relatively hard to implement, so I don’t expect this to happen any time soon.
For example, we would have to reverse-map the metadata associated with F#-specific types. This is already done in F# reflection FSharpType.IsRecord and so on.

What limits you from generating DUs and Records in type providers now? Is the limitation in the F# compiler itself, or in the ubiquitous ProvidedTypes.fs? If it's the latter, this feature could be implemented through a community effort.

@Jack - it's a compiler limitation (there's no way to provide the metadata that the F# compiler uses to recognize F#-specific types).

Yes please for this one; let's allow TPs to create idiomatic F# apis!

I plan to mark this feature as "approved in principle" (it will show as "planned"). It would be great if it were done.
