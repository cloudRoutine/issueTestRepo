F# Depth Colorizer Extension for Visual Studio 2013 [1] offers an entirely different, light years better quality of coding and readability of code in F# and deserves to be part of Visual Studio rather than a separate extension. Please turn the depth-colorizing functionality offered by that extension into a default IDE feature and part of the F# Language Service. The ability to write code that's VERY easy-to-read and understand (available to everyone, not only those who downloaded and installed the extension) will have a positive impact on the language popularity and improve the F# position in the TIOBE Programming Community index.
P.S. Xamarin Studio is also a good candidate to make this functionality available as a default IDE feature.

Please see the Visual F# Power Tools where this feature is available, http://fsprojects.github.io/VisualFSharpPowerTools/
Note that since this suggestion related to the Visual F# IDE Tools rather than the F# language itself, it rightly belongs in https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/category/30935-languages-f-tools

Why not just use the extension?

Almost all modern IDEs provide syntax highlighting, but not a single IDE provides depth colorizing as a default feature. Programmers who are starting to learn F#, as a rule, do not know about F# Depth Colorizer Extension for Visual Studio. Only experienced programmers know about it. If the functionality offered by that extension were available for all F# programmers regardless of their experience of coding in F#, it would have a positive impact on the language popularity and easiness of coding.
