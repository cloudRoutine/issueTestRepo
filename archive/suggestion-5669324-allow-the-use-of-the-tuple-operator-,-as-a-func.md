I've seen F# code like
fun x y = (x,y)
or
let tuple2 x y = (x,y)
used everywhere, I think it will be more elegant to allow to use the function (,) and (,,) and so on, as in Haskell.

This seems too corner case to warrant addition to the language: it is simple enough to use a named function such as "tuple2"
