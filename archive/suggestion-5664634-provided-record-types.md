The included type providers should have the option of emitting F# record types rather than class types.
For example, when reading and writing SQL data, your F# code has to either deal with classes, which don't have the nice benefits of F# records (immutability, copy/update syntax, code that is easier to reason about, fewer bugs, etc.), or you have to map your classes to corresponding F# records, do your processing, and then convert back to classes.
Having the option to provide F# record types would really bring the power of the language closer to the data.
