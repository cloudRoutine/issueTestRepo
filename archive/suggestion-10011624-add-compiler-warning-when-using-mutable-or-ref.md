add compiler flag: --warn-mutable, --warn-ref which would generate warning when using mutable (either mutable keyword or when using ref).
This would allow pure modules to be made.
Note that F# doesn't have any "pure" tags on member methods like the "const" qualifier on C++ methods.

See comment above. Declined since weâ€™d prefer this to be implemented in tools such as FSharpLint.

I don't see how it helps since you can still use some type from referenced assembly which is equivalent to ref.
BTW this can be implemented in linter (eg. VFPT).

FYI I suggested something similar to this in a comment to this other idea: [/archive/suggestion-5670335-pure-functions-pure-keyword](/archive/suggestion-5670335-pure-functions-pure-keyword.md)
NOTE: you can still use mutable locals (as oppoosed to fields), in immutable code (because local vars in a method cannot be shared among threads).

I would prefer if this were implemented in FSharpLint. I will decline this for the core language and please add a suggestion there, if it isn't available already.
