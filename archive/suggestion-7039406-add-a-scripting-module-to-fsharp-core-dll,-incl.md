I suggest we add a "Scripting" module to FSharp.Core.dll (.NET Framework Version) that makes F# Interactive a more fluent and connected scripting environment
Minimally, I want enough that F# scripts can meaningfully bootstrap a connection to a package tool in a succinct header to a script. For example
open Scripting
cd __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__
if not (fileExists "paket.exe") then
wget "https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/releases/download/0.26.2/paket.exe&quot;
;;
For example, this would enable very neat self-contained F# scripts to get and use packages: https://gist.github.com/dsyme/9c95a66a18b2c625b057
Some sample code is below - it is not complete or robust at all, and a considerable amount of discussion would be needed. Not all operations would necessarily be needed - as can be seen above, I only really feel the pain with regard to "wget". Further, the "wget" would need to be made robust with sensible defaults, e.g. See https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/blob/master/src/Paket.Bootstrapper/Program.cs#L93-L115.
module Scripting =
let (++) a v = System.IO.Path.Combine(a, v)
let filename filePath = System.IO.Path.GetFileName(filePath)
let changext filePath ext = System.IO.Path.ChangeExtension(filePath,ext)
let extension filePath = System.IO.Path.GetExtension(filePath)
let fullpath filePath = System.IO.Path.GetFullPath(filePath)
let rootdir filePath = System.IO.Path.GetPathRoot(filePath)
let basename filePath = System.IO.Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(filePath)
let dirname filePath = System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName(filePath)
let ls dirPath = System.IO.Directory.EnumerateFiles dirPath
let writeText filePath contents = System.IO.File.WriteAllText(filePath,contents)
let readText filePath = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(filePath)
let lines filePath = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(filePath)
let linesAsSeq filePath = System.IO.File.ReadLines(filePath)
let (.>>) contents filePath = System.IO.File.AppendAllText(filePath, contents)
let (.>) contents filePath = System.IO.File.WriteAllText(filePath, contents)
let cat filePath = linesAsSeq filePath |> Seq.iter System.Console.Out.WriteLine
let echo (text:string) = System.Console.Out.WriteLine text
let wget (url:string) =
use wc = new System.Net.WebClient ()
let tmp = System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName()
wc.DownloadFile(url, tmp)
let target = filename url
System.IO.File.Move(tmp,target)

let fileExists filePath = try System.IO.File.Exists filePath with _ -> false
let cd dirPath = System.Environment.CurrentDirectory <- dirPath

Note, I'm not particularly attached to the Unix names and don't necessarily think we should add those to a "Scripting" module in FSharp.Core.dll. But I am attached to the idea that getting a file from the web robustly and reliably with sensible download defaults suitable for scripting should be much easier than this kind of thing: https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/blob/master/src/Paket.Bootstrapper/Program.cs#L93-L115
That's especially because a single "web fetch" is an immensely powerful thing when it gets a .NET bootstrapping DLL which can be referenced later in the script. (In the example in the gist, initially the #r "paket.exe" reference is shown as unresolved. Once it has been downloaded by the user by executing the first part of the script the reference shows as resolved and can be evaluated).

See also this sample, which shows how you can add a Paket.exe download to an F# script without needing "wget" - i.e. in a way that works today

I'm closing this since few people have voted for it and it doesn't seem to be blocking people

I still think this would be really useful. Especially if it was built on top of the dotnetcore apis
