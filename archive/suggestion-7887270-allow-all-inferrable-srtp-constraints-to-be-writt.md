See https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/392. Basically F# will in some situations infer statically-resolved-constraints like
(A or ^b) : (static member X : ...)
where A is a concrete class name. However these constraints can't be written in signatures. It is reasonable to lift this restriction

BTW, the real problem is that it's not just in signature files; it can make it hard to write the necessary constraints for actual code too.
