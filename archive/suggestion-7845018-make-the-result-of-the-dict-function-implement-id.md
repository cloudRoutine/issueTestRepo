The fact that the type returned by dict doesn't implement IDictionary makes reflection difficult and inefficient, it also make this type different than all other .NET Core Dictionary implementations

This is approved for inclusion in a future release of the F# core library subject to an implementation and detailed design. Completion of the pull request to implement this feature will be necessary, see the link above.
