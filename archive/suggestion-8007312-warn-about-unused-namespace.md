It would be nice if F# compiler had a switch to warn about unused namespace similar to --warnon:1182 - unused bindings. This can be lower cost solution to what in Visual C# addressed by "Remove Unused Usings" refactoring.

Closing this. The “greying out unused namespaces” is available in the Visual F# Power Tools. The core implementation can be reused in other tools such as FSharpLint.
Further comments, use cases, information and discussion welcome

The closest thing is "Gray out unused opens" in Visual F# Power Tools. And it was tricky to implement.

As Vasily says, "grey out unused namespace" in the Visual F# Power Tools is close (and I think FCS-based tooling is the way we would always address for F#)
