This feature already exists in the form:
type Shame =
| Circle of centerX: float * centerY:float * radius:float
| ...
It supports pattern matching by the order of the field as well as the name.

I believe that discriminated unions containing inline records in their declarations is a great idea. It would improve the F# expressiveness. It is good that the F# language supports tuples with named items as Huw Simpson mentioned, but inline records in declarations of discriminated union types would be a new way of expressing programmers' ideas in code. F# should remain competitive and be better than OCaml, I think.

I think inline records can be named as "record expressions" or "records of an anonymous type" for the sake of terminology consistency in F#. There are object expressions in F# that are useful when there is no need to define a class. I think a situation when a language user needs to use a record expression of a compiler-generated anonymous record type instead of a user-defined record type is quite possible in practice and it will be good if the language has a solution able to meet competition with other programming languages.

This feature is currently deprecated in F# 3.0 and above. It was available I believe until F# 2.0. Maybe we can change the title to 'Undeprecate inline record in DU'. I have also created a ticket/issue in github visual f# repo. https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/1196#issuecomment-220172524

For me, the big advantage is that it would allow mutable inline records. This can be huge for performance.
