It would be nice to have a compiler directive for environment variables which can be used in string literals.
This way we can pass different parameters to type providers on a build server.
[<Literal>]
let ConnectionString = #env "MY_DB_CONNECTIONSTRING"
let cmd = new SqlCommandProvider<"...", ConnectionString>()

Lenne, what's wrong with already-existing .NET built-in Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable method (from namespace System)?
You can use a .NET built-in method instead of the #env syntax suggested. The name of the built-in method would make your code more readable.
Code example:
open System
[<Literal>]
let ConnectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MY_DB_CONNECTIONSTRING")
let cmd = new SqlCommandProvider<"...", ConnectionString>()
Please see for more details:
Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable Method (String)

Hope it helps.

Alexey, your example would cause "This is not a valid constant expression." error.
Lenne, do you mean the value to be substituted at compile time? (I guess yes as it is a compiler directive).
I'm not sure I see value in this, is there prior art (any other compiler does that?)
I generally move those type of strings in a separate module, and can consider generating this module file as a preliminary build step.
Also, I think this can be addressed by a type provider altogether, maybe you should consider this instead?
