when walking tree DU structures, it would be useful to pass match expressions to a walking function instead of being forced to hardwire it. Perhaps this also requires a match signature.
e.g.
static member walk ast =
let rec walk ast = ast |> function | ListOfX(_,l) -> [for e in l -> walk e] |> List.concat | e -> [e]
walk ast

You can already do this, match functions can be passed as lambdas.

Yes, this is what "function" is for as far as I understand the request.
