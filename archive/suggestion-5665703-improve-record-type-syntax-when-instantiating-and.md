type UserInfo { Id: int; Name: string }
type CompanyInfo { Id: int; Name: string }
let user = new { UserInfo.Id = 1; UserInfo.Name = "John Doe" }
Having to specify the type in each property takes more time, specially if the type contains several ones.
Proposed solution (like C#):
let user = new UserInfo { Id = 1; Name = "John Doe" }

But this already works. Just annotate the whole record with the type and you are done.
let user = { Id = 1; Name = "John Doe" } : UserInfo or use the annotation at the place where you
are using user as in
myFuncThatNeedsAUser user (might already be inferred correctly now) or else
myFuncThatNeedsAUser (user : UserInfo)

Thanks Daniel, I didn't know you can do that.
