static member (+) (foo1, foo2) = foo1.Bar + foo2.Bar

This seems more concrete than [/archive/suggestion-5666323-operator-overloads-problem-in-f](/archive/suggestion-5666323-operator-overloads-problem-in-f.md) but since it can already be done with inline + static type parameters I wonder what would be the benefit of doing it via type extensions.

See some commentary here that discusses a related problem and the relevant commpiler code: https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/workitem/2

This would help with generic arithmetic on novel types, e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25346246/why-cant-we-satisfy-f-static-member-constraints-with-type-extensions/25347602#25347602

Just ran into this problem today, and worked around it with the scary inline workaround :) Would be nice if this worked and didn't cause any problems elsewhere!

Yes, I need this too.
