It would be great to be able to do something like:
#save "CurrentState.dmp"
...
#restore "CurrentState.dmp"
It would be especially useful for interactive experimentation that deals with larger data

I don't know of any implementations of process checkpointing on Windows. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_checkpointing

I presume on Linux that existing process checkpointing techniques could be used, but it would be interesting to have it documented.
A state-serializing implementation based on the Nessos Vagabond library may be technically feasible, but only for a limited range of serializable data.

I'm closing this because it's very hard to achieve in a cross-platform way, and out of scope for fsi.exe/fsharpi in the core tooling
However it would be totally reasonable to build a checkpointing fsharpi on Linux based on the F# Compiler Service, where you can build and design your own F# Interactive executable utilizing what is available in the FSharp.Compiler.Service DLL
