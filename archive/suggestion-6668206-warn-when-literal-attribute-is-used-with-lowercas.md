The identifier of a literal must begin with an uppercase letter (as defined in 7.1 of the spec). If you assign the literal attribute with an identifier with lowercase first letter, it will ignore the literal attribute without any warning. Could we emit a warning when the literal attribute is not in effect due to the identifier used?

I think that it is already supported in FSharpLint tool http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpLint/
see `LiteralNamesMustBePascalCase` rule in http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpLint/FSharpLint.NameConventions.html
