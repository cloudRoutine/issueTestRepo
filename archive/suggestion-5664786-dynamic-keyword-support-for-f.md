There are times that e.g. F# value restriction could be solved with runtime dynamic code. C# has dynamic.
I wish F# could use dynamic as it uses mutable:
let I x = x
let dynamic F = II
As far as I know, there is no this kind of limitation in pure OCaml:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml#Church_numerals
This could also help cross-language-scenarios (like using SignalR-library) which is possible now, when importing C# core dll, etc, but not easy.
And it would also allow more dynamic actor/agent-model: how to upgrade agent's functionality's type syntax: http://fssnip.net/h3

Declining per the comments – the combination of the “?” operator, the “obj” type is sufficient for F#, plus the FSharp.Dynamic library is a good example of how to achieve this in purely library code.

FWIW, I use FSharp.Dynamic to address this scenario: https://github.com/ekonbenefits/FSharp.Dynamic
It works pretty well

Using existing C# libs that make use of dynamic is a fair argument. But IMO, F# should never support dynamic. Allowing dynamic is the opposite of what F# is, which is strongly typed. The ability to deviate from strong types just adds a layer complexity to the language which I think is unnecessary. I would hate to use existing F# code that made use of or exposed anything as dynamic; F# wouldn't feel the same in regards to safety.
A much stronger argument needs to be made for dynamic support.

How is the OCaml example related to "dynamic"? Also, that example works just fine in F#.

I'm totally agree with others, F# has a reach type system and has no need in 'dynamic' type.

Don, ? operator doesn't support generic methods. Also FSharp.Dynamic has no support for PCL.
So it cannot be used if you have a portable library. I prefer something baked into the language.
