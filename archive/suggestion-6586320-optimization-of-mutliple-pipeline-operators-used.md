Using an example:
```fsharp
let f x y z = ...
let fn = f <| 1 <| 2
```
Second line will result with generation of IL code for intermediate classes and delegates for each `<|` operator used in this single statement. Desired behavior would be to optimize this code to equivalent of `let fn = f 1 2`, that means all following pipeline intermediate results should be aggregated into single one containing all applied partial function applications.

I think a PR for this could just be submitted directly to the http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp repository. It doesn't need to be tracked here as a language design item.
