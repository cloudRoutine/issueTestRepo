Sometimes, you have to pass a function to a higher-order function, but you want that function to always return the same value, so you may end up writing something like
let ploeh = myHigherOrderFunction (fun _ -> 42) "Foo"
It would be nice with a built-in function that does this, sort of a dual of the built-in 'ignore' function.
Something like
let konst x _ = x
which would enable you to write something like
let fnaah = myHigherOrderFunction (konst 1337) "Bar"

Many thanks for the suggestion
I’m declining this because we did explicitly consider this in F# 1.0 (and also F# 4.0) and decided against adding a function to the prelude for this. I don’t think we should revisit that decision at this point.
The Operators prelude is a space of names we have to use somewhat conservatively. The name “konst” is not particularly pleasing, and the function is very, very simple to define as a helper function. So in balance we decided not to include this.

Like the idea, but suggest naming it 'constant'. konst smells like something from KDE.

If 'constant' is too long, 'always' also reads nicely.

All the better if we could make this independent of argument count. https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/constantly

@Dax Clojure's constantly (and Common Lisp's CONSTANTLY) only takes one argument. Its _returned function_ takes any number of arguments.
A naive implementation might look like
let constantly x = fun ([<System.ParamArray>] ignored) -> x

Since it is so easy to define this function as a utility in your own code I'm not sure we need have it in the F# library.
This is consistent to the design approach we've take to a number of other functionals, e.g. swapping the elements of a tuple, or a function to do pointwise "and" and "or" on two Boolean-valued functions.
