See the example here under the "Conflict Resolution" heading:

Prefixing the type on a label seems inconsistent with how types are annotated elsewhere in the language. Perhaps something like this with the type annotation on the end would be more consistent:
"let myRecord = {} : RecordTypeName"

Yes, as noted in the comments a type annotation can already be used.

You can already do this as follows:
"let myRecord : RecordTypeName = {...}"

Very helpful, thank you. I can't recall seeing that elsewhere.
