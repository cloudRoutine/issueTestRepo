F# has various syntaxes for defining numeric sequences. Some examples:
> { 0 .. 5 };;
val it : seq<int> = seq [0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
> seq { 0 .. 5 };; // Same thing (seq keyword is optional)
val it : seq<int> = seq [0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
> { 0 .. 2 .. 10 };;
val it : seq<int> = seq [0; 2; 4; 6; 8; 10]
> [for x in 0 .. 5 -> x * x];; // brackets can be omitted in for .. in loop
val it : int list = [0; 1; 4; 9; 16; 25]
I think it would be useful to omit the final argument to allow infinite sequences. I'm envisioning something like this:
{ 1 .. } // The positive integers
{ 2 .. 4 .. } // The positive even integers
These are IMO more readable than their Seq.initInfinite equivalents:
Seq.initInfinite ((+)1)
Seq.initInfinite (fun n -> 2 * (n + 1))
We could also use three dots for the final ellipsis to make the intent more explicit, but I'm not sure this is really useful.
Haskell allows this functionality as follows:
[ 1 .. ] -- The positive integers
[ 2, 4 ... ] -- The positive even integers
Another nice thing Haskell allows you to do is count down with sequences, but attempting to do that with F# will result in an empty sequence.
seq { -1 .. -2 .. -10 } // F# - empty sequence
[-1, -2 .. -10 ] -- Haskell - all negative integers
That probably can't be changed due to backwards compatibility, and I'm not even sure if it would be desirable anyway.

Thanks for the suggestion. Declined per comment below.

Regarding counting down: "seq { -1 .. -2 .. -10 }" returns -1,-3,-5,-7,-9 for me, so it does seem to be supported (tried in LINQPad 4, not sure which F# version it uses).

Hmm... I must have tested it without including the step. In that case, it works just like Haskell, so you can ignore that last part. Good catch!

I'm quite OK to leave infinite sequence literals out of F#. They are just a bit of a minefield waiting to go off when the sequence accidentally gets iterated. It think it's better to be much more explicit when creating infinite sequences. e.g. Seq.initInfinite etc.
