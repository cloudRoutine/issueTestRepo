I seem to be joining two arrays of varying types quite often to do comparisons.
For example:
let nums = [| 0; 1 |]
let alphas = [| "a"; "b" |]
let compare n a = ...
I would like:
alphas |> Array.foralli (fun i a -> compare nums.[i] a)

Combining with [/archive/suggestion-6952125-create-filteri-functions-for-the-various-collect](/archive/suggestion-6952125-create-filteri-functions-for-the-various-collect.md) and treating that one as canonical as it has more votes

Note that you can use `Array.forall2` in your particular case.
