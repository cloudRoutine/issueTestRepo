Currently all for and while loops must specify "do" before the statements:
for i = 1 to 10 do
printfn "Hello World"
This does not feel intuitive for developers coming from Python or BASIC. The "do" should not be required by the parser as for example "in" is no longer required in the default light syntax mode.

I sometimes forget the "then" on an if/else/elif and wonder if it could be made optional along the same lines. Only other thing I can think of that is like this is the "with" in a match expression, though I kind of like one that for some reason.

Oppose. This is of little utility, and does not jibe with the way ML parsing is intended to work. Same opposition applies to optional 'then'.

Also oppose due to the inconsistency this will create among code bases and styles so late in the game. It just isn't buying us much.

I don't think this is even possible. You need the `do` keyword to separate the `for` expressions from the code that is being executed in the loop.
Using your example, you would like to write:
for i = 1 to count printfn "Hello world"
Did you mean:
for i = 1 to count do printfn "Hello world"
or:
for i = 1 to (count printfn "hello world") do ...

Richard, I'd expect the `do` keyword may still be used when writing multiple statements on a single line, just as the `in` keyword is still required in F# in this scenario. This is how Ruby approaches while & for loops, see http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm

I do understand that Python and BASIC users may find the extra "do" and "then" keywords non-intuitive. In a different world, we may have opted to use ":" or some other line-terminator.
However, I think this decision is now fixed in stone for F#, I don't see us making this specific change in anything but a wholesale revision of the language syntax, which is not on the agenda any time soon.
So I'm marking this as declined.
