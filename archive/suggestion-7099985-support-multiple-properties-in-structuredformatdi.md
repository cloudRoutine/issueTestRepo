There's currently a limitation in StructuredFormatDisplayAttribute whereby you can only provide a single property in the Value.
So for a type like this: type Person = {First: string; Last: string} I have to create another property like FullName to use in StructuredFormatDisplayAttribute. The fix/enhancement should be easy to do, and something I could probably just do myself.
I first broached this subject on StackOverflow and Tomas Petricek suggested I create an issue for this. Here's the link to the SO question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28505368/can-i-use-multiple-properties-in-a-structuredformatdisplayattribute
