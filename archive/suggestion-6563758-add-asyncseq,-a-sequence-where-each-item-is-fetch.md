Incorporate asynchronous sequences with associated module (with similar methods to the Seq module) and computation expression builder.
Existing implementations:
FSharpx: https://github.com/fsprojects/fsharpx/blob/master/src/FSharpx.Core/AsyncSeq.fs
ExtCore: https://github.com/jack-pappas/ExtCore/blob/master/ExtCore/Collections.AsyncSeq.fs

Using event streams in an ordered fashion seems to be the best fit for AsyncSeq, but as async APIs increase they may have other uses and it make sense to add them to the core. For example, I'm using them to handle async cursors in the HTML5 IndexedDB API.

I believe this should be done as an independent nuget package. It is extremely useful.
I would recommend creating a new project at http://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq and just getting this under way

This is addressed through http://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq. Please use that library.
