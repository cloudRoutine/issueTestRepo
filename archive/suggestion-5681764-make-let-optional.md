Make F# even more terse by removing the requirement for the let keyword, particularly on local variables.

How would you distinguish between the definition x=2 and the test for equality x=2?

I've made a related suggestion that doesn't completely get rid of "let", but allows a single let to create multiple bindings. This is similar to how "where" in Haskell can group together a number of bindings. See "Allow a single let to create multiple bindings" for details.

Go uses a slightly different operator to distinguish assignment from definitition with assignment - F# could use a slightly different operator to distinguish definition from equality.

I propose to decline this. A completely revamped F# syntax may choose to make let optional. But I don't think it is really technically feasible within the current F# syntax.

I think it's a great idea!
But I agree that making things optional opens up the door for multiple ways of doing the same thing, which adds unnecessary cognitive load for maintainers.
My suggestion is - that if it is optional, that it is a toggle feature that requires all code per-project(or solution) mandatory to have let, or mandatory to not have the let for that project, but not to be able to mix let and no let in the same project.
