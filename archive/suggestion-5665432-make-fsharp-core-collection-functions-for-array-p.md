In F# 3.0, lots of standard functions are missing from Array.Parallel including tryFindIndex, exists, forall, filter, tryFind, reduce, minBy, maxBy and tryPick. A mapReduce function would also be useful.
Efficient implementations of all of these have been described in the F# Journal. http://fsharpnews.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/parallel-aggregates.html

Approved in principle subject to RFC and well-tested implementation being submitted as PR.

I am going to mark this as "approved in principle". That is, we would accept design additions with well-tested implementations of coherent subsets of these functions.
If someone would like to submit a PR for these that would be great.
