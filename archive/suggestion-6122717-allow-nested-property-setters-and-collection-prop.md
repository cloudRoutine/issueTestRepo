I suggest we consider allowing A.B=expr property setters in initializers, e.g.

UIButton(UIButtonType.Custom, Layer.BorderWidth = 1.0, Layer.BorderColor=UIColor.Gray.CGColor, Radius = size / 2.0)
cf. https://github.com/dvdsgl/shallow/blob/master/Shallow/RoundButton.fs#L6
Also, we should consider allowing collection setters, e.g.
C(CollectionProperty = [ 1;2;3 ])
where CollectionProperty has the "Add" pattern of C#. One design would make it tht any IEnumerable<T> would be assignable, where T corresponds to the type of an Add method, though that may not be fully compatible with the C# mechanism.

Having an IList<_>.Add mechanism as mentioned would make interop with lots of C# more palatable as extra create methods would ordinarily have to be added or assign an intermediate type.

It might be more readable to explicitly specify the property setter to distinguish it from a standard setter with something like
let init values f = values |> Seq.iter f
C(CollectionProperty.Add |> init [1;2;3])
Or use a property setter extension which adds the items to given collection.
C(InitializingCollectionPropertyExtension = [1;2;3])

An initial implementation of this feature has now been submitted here: https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/EdwardPaul/AllowNestedAndColllectionPropSetters

Hi Paul,
That's great news! I'll definitely be taking a look at this.
Could you submit a pull request for that branch so we can see the overall changes more easily? (You may need to rebase the branch) Also could you write up a description of what is and isn't allowed (this should also match your testing)
Thanks
Don

(BTW I now see the implementation in the "master" branch of https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/EdwardPaul/AllowNestedAndColllectionPropSetters)

(Also, for those wondering, the design is summarized in this commit: https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/EdwardPaul/AllowNestedAndColllectionPropSetters/changeset/147eff4c8542fd5d5f1e351c831da7d653d679f3)

(That's the proposed, experimental design)
