let's say we have the following:
type RecordA =
{ A : int
B : string }
type RecordB =
{ A : bool
B : RecordA }
let a = { A = false
B = { A = 2
B = "foo" } }
and want to update that 2 to a 3.
Currently, we need to do this:
let a' = { a with B = { a.B with A = 3 } }
which doesn't scale to more complex types
It would be nice to have something like
let a' = { a with B.A = 3 }
or something similar
It would also be nice to be able to have something similar with DUs:
type DU =
| Case of p1:int * p2:string
let a = Case(1, "foo")
let a' = { a with p1 = 2 }

This sounds like a good idea.
Apologies if I don't understand this well enough, but isn't this really asking for Lenses in F#? http://bugsquash.blogspot.dk/2011/11/lenses-in-f.html

That doesn't mean we would implement first-class lensing. But I think the linked issue opens up several important parts of the design discussion, for example how would this work on class types that are not record types (and also how would this work for collection types). At least we should look at the topic of functional update a bit more holistically than this specific request, even if in the end this is all we do.
