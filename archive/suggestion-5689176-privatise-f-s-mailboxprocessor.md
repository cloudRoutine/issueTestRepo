The UK government privatised Royal Mail for £3,000,000,000. It's basically a MailboxProcessor. F# has a MailboxProcessor type, lighter and more efficient than Royal Mail. Can we privatise the MailboxProcessor type too?
If we do, maybe we can use the funds to build a MessageProcessor type, to be acquired by Facebook?

Sold. We’ve spent the proceeds on beer.
