When working with F#'s "functional" types (e.g., records and unions), I
have often wished that one could organize a module like:
| Functional Type Declarations (without augmentations)
| Functions manipulating the declared types
| Augmentations for the declared types (e.g., with equality and
comparison defined using the functions declared above).
I have particularly wanted this when the types are mutually recursive; I
believe in that case it is much clearer to be able to define the types
alone without mixing in the code from augmentations.

Yes, this can be done today, as per the comment from Marc Sigrist

You can actually do this already now, using intrinsic extensions (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233211.aspx). As long as the extensions are defined in the same file, they are compiled as "real" members of the type.

For completeness, I'll just note that an augmentation (even in the same file) cannot provide an interface implementation (and so cannot provide an IComparable for a [<CustomComparison>] type). Also, providing an Equals override in an augmentation results in a deprecation warning.
