Currently it's awkward to convert between numeric types and preserve the units, since we end up with a whole raft of conversion functions like:
let i2f (x: int<'u>) : float<'u> =
float x |> LanguagePrimitives.FloatWithMeasure
where for N numeric types, we have N^2 of these functions.
Ideally, the functions int, float, decimal, etc., would preserve the units automatically.

I suspect the breaking change implications of this would make it tricky to do.
