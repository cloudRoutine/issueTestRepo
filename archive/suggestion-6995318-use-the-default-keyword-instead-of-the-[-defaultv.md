Use the default keyword instead of the [<DefaultValue>] attribute
Programming is a human activity. I think F# code has to be more elegant and readable for human programmers.
So, instead of coding:
type MyType() =
let mutable myInt1 = 10
[<DefaultValue>] val mutable myInt2 : int
[<DefaultValue>] val mutable myString : string
member this.SetValsAndPrint( i: int, str: string) =
... member body ...
it would be better and more elegant to write:
type MyType() =
let mutable myInt1 = 10
val mutable default myInt2 : int
val mutable default myString : string
member this.SetValsAndPrint( i: int, str: string) =
... member body ...
Please declare the [<DefaultValue>] attribute as an obsolete (unrecommeded to use in new code) feature in the F# language specification, but remain it in the language for compatibility with the existing codebase.

Attributes like [<DefaultValue>], [<Sealed>], [<AbstractClass>] and [<VolatileField>] were deliberately not made keywords in order to keep language simple AND to embrace FP where all these stuff are not used at all.

Vasily is right - default values for mutable fields are not really "normal" in F# and functional programming - it would be more normal in F# to initialize the values of the fields.
