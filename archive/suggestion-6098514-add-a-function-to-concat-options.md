I suggest the following enhancement to the Option module:
// Combines the given option-of-option into a single option.
let concat value =
match value with
| None -> None
| Some o -> o
concat : value : 'a option option -> 'a option

Declining as “Option.bind id” is a suitable workaround, or it is very easy to define this function in user code.

You can use "Option.bind id" for that exactly

I would call that "flatten" instead. concat would take more than one (unnested) option.
