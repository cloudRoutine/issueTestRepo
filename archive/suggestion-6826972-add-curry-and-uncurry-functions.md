let curry f x y = f (x, y)
let uncurry f (x, y) = f x y
As implemented in Fsharpx. I have a sample implementation here:

I was about to suggest the same one this morning! I give it my last remaining 2 votes...

It seems F# already has the uncurry function, AKA the "backward double pipe" operator (<||)

I don't think the curry function can be implemented as an operator as it takes 3 arguments.
Also, it seems curry/uncurry has been discarded as an idea previously, from reading this discussion [although this discussion doesn't mention the existence of (<||)]:

There's also ||> for uncurrying as well.

F# has no flip/curry/uncurry operators in the prelude - we did consider them of course in F# 1.x but made a definite decision not to include them. OCaml made the same decision at that time. Code that uses these is often of reduced readability. Not always, but in my experience too often.
