The idea title should be F# query expression with pipelined style
dataSource
|>Sql.where (fun a->a.ColumnA)
|>Sql.sortBy (fun a->a.ColumnB)
|>Sql.skip 10
|>Sql.take 20
|>Sql.run
|>Seq.iter (fun a->printfn "%s" (string a.ColumnA))

You can actually do this as a library today if you try hard enough. Just make Sql a type and each of the functions a method that takes a quotation as an argument implicitly.
Either way, this belongs in a library not in FSharp.Core.
