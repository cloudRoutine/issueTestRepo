Currently this code is disallowed:
type Statistics =
Map<string,double>
with
static member parse (inStr:string) =
...
It would be very useful to be able to extend type abbreviations so we don't have to wrap the underlying type inside a record.

Thanks for the suggestion.
Given the way that type abbreviations are compiled (they are erased by the F# compiler), it is unlikely that we would allow extensions of abbreviations themselves – for example, would the method be available on the abbreviated type as well? How/where would the method exist in the compiled form?
FWIW we considered this in F# 1.0 but decided against it. I don’t think anything specific has changed to warrant us revising that choice at this stage.
As stated in the comment, using a single-case discriminated union or a single-element record type is a suitable workaround.

What is wrong with this?:
type Statistics = Statistics of Map<string, double> with
static member parse (insTr:string)=
...
