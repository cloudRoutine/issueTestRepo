The modules and types from the FSharp.Core dll use the names "Microsoft.FSharp.Collections" etc.
Since the F# language is now cross-platform and open-source, it is appropriate that source code be able to optionally use just "FSharp.Collections". This would also mean the names match the name of the DLL (FSharp.Core).
This would not be a breaking change, existing code would continue to compile.
The compiled form used in FSharp.Core.dll wouldn't change, for reasons of binary compatibility.

This has been completed for F# 4.0+, see https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/blob/master/FSharp-4.0/MicrosoftOptionalDesignAndSpec.md
The overall status for F# 4.0+ is here: https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/wiki/F%23-4.0-Status

Is this a breaking change? In other words will references to Microsoft.FSharp.Collections need to be changed before a program will compile under F# 4.0?

I don't believe it's a bad thing to keep "Microsoft" prefix as a remainder that F# started as a contribution of Microsoft to the community. This can be an incentive for big companies to contribute to open source projects.

@JohnTarbox - using the "Microsoft" prefix would be optional (as stated in the title of the suggestion)

This will indeed break applications that, contain types with the names of our collection types in the namespace fsharp.collections. That may not be very likely but it could happen.

Hi Kevin - Yes, I'd like to investigate this to make sure this is not a breaking change.
The F# name resolution rules currently mean that types defined in non-FSharp.Core DLLs would have precedence (F# name resolution prefers the most recently introduced type based on the assembly reference list and "open" declarations, Since FSharp.Core comes first in asssembly resolution, later types will have precedence).
However there are some exceptions that we need to innvestigate, particularly for generic types that get overloaded on arity. However that case will very rare indeed and any example would be very contrived - but we'll still check it out.
