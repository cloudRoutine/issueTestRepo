Often I want to reference different libraries based on whether the FSI is running in 32 bit or 64 bit mode. I often have to test two versions of an assembly, and it's enough of a pain just changing the flag every time, let alone change the references. Being able to do:
#if 64_BIT
#r "My64BitLib.dll"
#else
#r "My32BitLib.dll"
#endif

This is approved for inclusion in a future release of F# subject to an implementation and detailed design. A pull request to implement this feature will be necessary and we encourage contributors to submit one with adequate design detail and testing to http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp. Discussion of the particular version for this to be included in can be made once an implementation is available.
Design detail can also be discussed below.

This seems entirely reasonable for scripting code.
I'll mark it as "approved in principle", however the Visual F# Tools team and others may have opinions about how we deal with this kind of configuration parameter. Probably the best thing to do is send a PR to http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp and continue the discussion there, then link back to this discussion.
