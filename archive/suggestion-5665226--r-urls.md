We do something like that with a project at Bayard Rock, except we use #N for nuget and it automatically goes and gets it, and pulls in the correct references for the specific version of the runtime.
We'll be adding it to the ipython F# profile soon.

Would be great to have this for NuGet

Ok. I think this is *much* simpler than referencing a Nuget package.

+3 Simple, beautiful.

I think this is not allowed in a Microsoft programming model for security reasons (a scripting referencing a malicious DLL can be sent around, and even the act of opening the script might compromise things if the referenced DLL contains a type provider).
