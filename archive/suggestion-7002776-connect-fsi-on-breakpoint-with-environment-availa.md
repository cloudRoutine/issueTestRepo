I work professionally with F# and I really like the language but there is one thing I find annoying when debugging code, sometimes, variables captured thru closures cannot be seen in either locals or doing a mouse-over. This got me thinking into how the debugging could be improved and I think one thing that would be really great is having the possibility to connect FSI when the program is paused and also have it being fed the environment. The possibility to write F# code to inspect the current state would be great.

This should be a suggestion for the Visual F# Tools, at the Visual Studio User Voice.

(This is not specific to the F# language or core library)
