FSI output properly handles 'Some x', but often prints 'None' as 'null', apparently when the value is part of a larger type.
let x : uint16 option = None
correctly results in: val x : uint16 option = None
let y : string * uint16 option = "", None
instead prints: val y : string * uint16 option = ("", null)

This should certainly be fixed, as much as possible

Yes please, this can be pretty annoying (especially when trying to show people F#)

printfn "%A" None

printfn "%O" None
(1, null)
