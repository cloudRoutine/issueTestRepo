For brevity instead of
query { (*... body *) } |> Seq.toList
allow
query [ (* body *) ]

As a workaround, you can also add a suitable ToList extension member to QueryBuilder and put it into the query itself, which looks a bit cleaner than piping to Seq.toList.

The use of Seq.toList or the workaround below seems adequate for this case.
