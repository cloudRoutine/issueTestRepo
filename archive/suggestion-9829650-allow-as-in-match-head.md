I always seem to be doing this, which seems natural, but isn't allowed:
match ((fn h) as res) with
| ...

BTW, the reason is that if there are many following complex matches then you wouldn't need to wrap each in a "(...) as res" to capture the original un-de-structured result.

If you're using this in a lot of match cases, maybe using a local binding before the match would be easier...
let res = fn h
match res with
| ...

But that's a whole extra line, dude :)
Seriously though, it's not big deal, but seems consistent with allowing these in assignments and pattern matches.
They could just be allowed anywhere:
if (fn h) as res = 42 then printfn "%d" res

I don't think this adds enough to really be necessary in the language. I'm marking as declined, though thank you for the suggestion.
