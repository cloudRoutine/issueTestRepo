Just as you can use CLIMutable to store records using Entity Framework wouldn't is be nice to be able to set an CLIVirtual attribute on a record field of an ICollection type so that Entity Framework can do lazy loading.

In addition to making the property virtual, you would also have to make the record type non-sealed since EF creates dynamic proxy types that inherit from the base entity to override the virtual properties. Right now, all record types are sealed.
