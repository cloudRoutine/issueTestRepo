The following code should issue a type checking error since return () should yield an Async<unit> and return 42 should yield an Async<int>.
let f c =
async {
return ()
printfn "You passed %A and I am returning 42" c
return 42
}
Additionally the following code should issue a warning since the return statement does not actually affect the flow of execution as the name suggests (The printf statement is actually executed).
let g c =
async {
return ()
printfn "You passed %A and I am returning 42" c
return ()
}

See comment
Approved in principle, though definitely subject to a more detailed satisfactory design (not to adhoc,not specific to “async”)

Return in computation expressions is the monodic "return" (or "pure") and has nothing in common with return in imperative languages like C#. What's more, return usually == yield.

I do agree that ideally this should be caught, and some kind of warning given.
I don't specifically have a design in mind, but I am going to mark this as "planned", though subject to a detailed design, implementation and testing. I don't expect it to be a top-priority, but from the design perspective I'm ok with us looking for a solution to this specific problem.
