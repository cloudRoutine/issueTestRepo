Most major programming languages have recognition by a standards body such as ANSI or ISO. If F# is to be recognized as more than just a "Microsoft Language" then it is important that it be codified in a standard by an independent standards body.

Closing as, per most of the comments, this is premature.
Note that C# has only been standardized up to 2.0, and it is expensive to submit to a standards org.

It may be easier (and therefore more likely) to get F# standardized through ECMA rather than ANSI or ISO. The .NET CLR is standardized as ECMA-335, C# 2.0 is ECMA-334, and C++/CLI is ECMA-372.

This is the worst idea ever because that would effectively kill all further innovation in the language! Since F# is a relatively young language with a small user base it's still free to rapidly innovate and add new features or even change existing features. This is one of its appeals for me. ISO standardisation would stop all that and updates would happen every 10 years or so at best. If you want a "frozen" entrenched language go with one the classic business languages like C++ or Java.

I would tend to agree with Steven on this point. A relatively young language with a small but growing user base should not be standardized as it may slow down innovation. There are still some features missing such as type classes, functors, GADTs or even some sort of dependent typing, just to name a few, that may be difficult to add if a language is prematurely standardized.

+1m for ype classes, functors, GADTs & ependent typing.
Has anybody opened a suggestion for them already?

Also polymorphic variants

Also built in Code Contracts like WhyML

If there is interest in any of them other than just me somebody please open a suggestion.

Based on the age and userbase of F#, I have to agree that it's premature to lock in the design of F# through certification by ANSI or ISO. F# is a very young and very exciting programming language that still has ways to go.
