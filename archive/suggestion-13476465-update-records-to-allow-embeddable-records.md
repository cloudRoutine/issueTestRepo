Update the sytax of records to allow the following:
type Position = {X : int; Y : int}
type Sprite = {
Position
Name : string
Image : array byte }
Which would result in the Position records fields being embedded into Sprite.
The Go language has such a feature which works quite nicely:

What the construction syntax would look like? In Go it's like this:
type Base struct {
X int
Y int
}
type Foo struct {
Base
Z int
}
func main() {
foo := Foo { Base { 1, 2 }, 3 }
fmt.Println(foo.X + foo.Y + foo.Z)
}

This looks the same as this suggestion: [/archive/suggestion-12879717-allow-record-inheritance-multiple-inheritance](/archive/suggestion-12879717-allow-record-inheritance-multiple-inheritance.md)

Oh I see, you mean a sort of mixin of Position into Sprite, e.g. "include Position"
There are zillions of issues associated with this - e.g. what about subtyping? what about members on "Position"? Would Position have to be a struct?
I'd like to see more examples of the utility of this.
