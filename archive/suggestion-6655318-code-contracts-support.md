This has been discussed but I believe it should be F# that can fix it.
F# compiler does a lot of magic. Especially if we put Contract.Requires to the beginning of a method or a constructor, F# can (if it is a constructor it will) put additional code.
There is nothing code contract team can do anything about this because this is about how F# compiler works. It basically adds code to the prologue methods and ctors. What compiler can do is to respect System.Diagnostics.Contract class and don't put any code above it.
Example:
Suppose you have this code:
type RationalEx =
val numerator : int

new(num : int) as this =
{ numerator = num }
then
Contract.Requires(this.numerator>0)
this.Check(this.numerator)

member this.Check(num:int)=
Contract.Requires(num > 0 )
()
When it is compiled and checked from reflector what you will see is
For the constructor:
public RationalEx(int num)
{
FSharpRef<Program.RationalEx> this = new FSharpRef<Program.RationalEx>(null);
base();
this.numerator@ = num;
this.contents = this;
this.init@5 = 1;
Contract.Requires(LanguagePrimitives.IntrinsicFunctions.CheckThis<Program.RationalEx>(this.contents).numerator@ > 0);
LanguagePrimitives.IntrinsicFunctions.CheckThis<Program.RationalEx>(this.contents).Check(LanguagePrimitives.IntrinsicFunctions.CheckThis<Program.RationalEx>(this.contents).numerator@);
}
and for the method
public void Check(int num)
{
if (this.init@5 < 1)
{
LanguagePrimitives.IntrinsicFunctions.FailInit();
}
Contract.Requires(num > 0);
}
as you see it adds some magic code on top of the contract code by magic. And this causes contract checker and rewriter to fail

Declining this because it is the remit of the code contracts tool. I think they should make a fix in this case, or simply ignore the added F# initialization checking code.
Further discussion and input welcome.

Why doe this require a fix in F# rather than in the Code Contracts tool?
