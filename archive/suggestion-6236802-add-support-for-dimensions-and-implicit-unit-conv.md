Dimensions could be described as discriminated unions of a set of units (Measure's). It should also be possible to convert units explicitly to the base unit.
// some units
[<Measure>] type Kelvin
[<Measure>] type DegreeCelsius
[<Measure>] type DegreeFahreinheit
// Example: dimensions
// Advantage: failwith condition not needed anymore, because of additional checking by the compiler -> less bugs
[<Measure>] type Time = Second | Minute
[<Measure>] type Temperature = Kelvin | DegreeCelsius | DegreeFahreinheit
let temperatureToSI (value : float<Temperature>) : float<Kelvin> =
match value with
| :? float<Kelvin> -> value
| :? float<DegreeCelsius> -> (value - 273,15<DegreeCelsius>) * 1.0<Kelvin/DegreeCelsius>
| :? float<DegreeFahreinheit> -> (value + 459,67<DegreeFahreinheit>) * 5.0<Kelvin> / 9.0<DegreeFahreinheit>
// | _ -> failwith "unknown temperature"
// Example: implicit unit conversion
// Advantage: derived units always converts to base unit when used
[<Measure>] type Second
[<Measure>] type Minute (value:float) : (float<Second>) = value * 60.0<Second/Minute>

Thanks for the suggestion. Marking as declined as part of house keeping per my comment below. However weâ€™re still interested in collecting more feedback over time on this issue.

We decided against this in F# 2.0 because it requires witness passing (i.e. passing extra arguments around in generic code and storing them in generic classes) , and it is not particularly apparent where the floating point conversions get applied in generic code
I also would have though this issue might get more votes, and it's interesting to me that it has only one.
I will mark the issue as declined as part of house keeping, though we're still interested in collecting more feedback on this
