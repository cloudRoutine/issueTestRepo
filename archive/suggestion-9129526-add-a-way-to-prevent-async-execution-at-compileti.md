There are sometimes operations such as COM that don't play very well with threading. It would be nice if there was a way to denote that a function is not threadsafe and cannot be used from within a thread. e.g. if someone tries to use parallel a compile error would show up indicating that the function cannot be used from within a thread.

Many thanks for the suggestion
Declining this as it is not a specific design proposal, so it’s difficult to know what’s being voted on.
If you’d like to re-propose, please resubmit with a more detailed description of the problem with examples and/or a more concrete design proposal.

What do you mean by "within a thread"? All code execution happens on _some_ thread. So if a particular function was prohibited from executing "within a thread", it could not be executed at all.
