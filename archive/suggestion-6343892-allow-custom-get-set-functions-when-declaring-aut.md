Auto-properties are nice, but there should be a way of providing functions for the get and set methods so that e.g. setting a property can automatically call other side-effecting functions. In other words, it would be nice to be able to write this:
type foo(?boolguy, ?settyguy) =
member val boolguy = defaultArg boolguy true with get
member val x.settyguy = defaultArg settyguy 1 with get, set v = x.settyguy <- v; printfn "hi"
Right now, you have to write this instead:
type foo(?boolguy, ?settyguy) =
let mutable _settyguy = defaultArg settyguy 1
member val boolguy = defaultArg boolguy true with get
member x.settyguy with get() = _settyguy and set v = _settyguy <- v; printfn "hi"
The proposed "member val x.settyguy" syntax would be a non-breaking change, because it's currently not legal syntax. In fact, there is a bug regarding this: in FSI, this passes without any warning or error:
type foo(?settyguy) =
member val x.settyguy = 1 with get, set
member x.settyguy = 1234
let () =
let q = foo()
printfn "%A" foo.settyguy // prints 1234
In FSC, the "member val x.settyguy" is flagged as an error.

For me, the second code you show gives an error about a duplicate definition, in both FSI and FSC

Seems that FSI doesn't directly accept it, but in emacs fsharp-mode, if you put the second code into foo.fsx and do C-c C-f (fsharp-load-buffer-file), it passes.

That's very odd! I wonder if something unusual is going on in the emacs mode

My view on this proposal is that the syntax is not really that good for F# as it stands. While the syntax using a "let mutable" is longer, it is regular uses existing constructs. Making further additions to the auto-property syntax at this stage doesn't seem the right tradeoff of value v. language-churn. It's possible we could revisit this in a later stage.
For now I think we should decline this - though it's not a bad idea as such.
