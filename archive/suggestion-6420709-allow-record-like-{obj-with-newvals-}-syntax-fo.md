The { oldObj with newval1=x ... } syntax is great syntax - I'd like to see it available for other objects, whether they are defined in F# or not.
I suggest:
- If the object has an IRecordClone (or whatever) implementation (or simply an implementation of a required method), then call it first. This would allow the copying of private data, etc. It returns the new object.
- If there was no pre-copy method to call, or after it runs, perform the standard record-like behavior of copying Public properties over to the new object.

- *Copying all but the override values*
- and finally setting the new values, obviously

The related feature is to allow records to take part in inheritance
