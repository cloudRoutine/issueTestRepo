With the upcoming rollout of the normalized collections API across the List, Array, and Seq modules, it would be great to see Array2D ( and possibly the other higher dimension Array Modules) brought into the fold.
A large portion of the collections API (avg, contains, exists, find, fold, forall, max, min, scan, sum, etc.) could be implemented for Array2D in a way that conforms with the other collections modules.
Other functions like append and concat should be workable if they enforce constraints on the length of the [,]'s dimensions similiar to the ones on the length of collections for the zip functions.
Functions like filter that will likely remove elements in a manner that doesn't map to a filled 'T [,] could return 'T [] instead.

Hi Jared
My view is that this best lies outside the core. It would be entirely reasonable to have it in an FSharp.Core.ArrayFunctions community project and nuget package.
