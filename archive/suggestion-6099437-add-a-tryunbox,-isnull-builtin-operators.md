# Idea 6099437: Add a tryUnbox, isNull builtin operators #

### Status : completed

Add builtin functions:
tryUnbox : obj -> 'T option
isNull: 'T -> bool when 'T : null
The first is an unbox operation which if successful would return Some<'a> on a successful unbox and None for a fail. This would allow the Option module to be used efficiently for single type matches and processing.

How about the operator has the name "tryUnbox" , as in x |> tryUnbox<string>

I was thinking more of an extended operator to supplement :> and :?>
Nothing spring to mind that would be intuitive though.

Essentially its just:
let inline tryUnbox<'a> (x:obj) =
match x with
| :? 'a as result -> Some (result)
| _ -> None
Although it might want some direct IL generated like the other primitives.

Looks great. How about ':/>'
?
Keystrokes are almost the same, just one less 'Shift' keypress.

This is really similar to: [/archive/suggestion-6103054-add-option-ofnull-to-help-remove-nulls](/archive/suggestion-6103054-add-option-ofnull-to-help-remove-nulls.md)
I would prefer this as a primitive though.
Don would a symbol be considered here?

Hi Dave,
My instinct is that we wouldn't consider a symbol here, but would consider a named primitive ala tryUnbox
cheers

I think a named function would suffice as this can be piped into in any case.
I expect a more efficient implementation could be achieved through use of in line IL e.g. (# ... # )

I have submitted a PR for tryUnbox and isNull in FSharp.Core for F# 4.0+ https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/dsyme/cleanup/contribution/7672
