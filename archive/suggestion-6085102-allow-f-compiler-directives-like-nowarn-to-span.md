You could use #endnowarn "[number]" to explicitely end a compiler directive.

In C#, this feature exists, and has the following form:
#pragma warning disable 618
code...
#pragma warning enable 618
This enables you to suppress specific compiler warnings locally, which is quite important for evolving APIs: sometimes you need to deprecate a particular API (function, type), but keep it around for backwards compatibility. This means that your own code may still need to use the deprecated code for a while longer (for e.g. unit tests), so it'd be nice to enable that scenario without suppressing all other warnings.
