# Idea 5675548: Implement monadic getters and setters #

The get/set syntax for F# is very cool, but it has an issue: sometimes, the property we would like to get and set is only available through a workflow/monad, like the async workflow.
Thus, I would like to alter the typechecking rules for getters and setters. This is what they are right now (pseudocode) for the Async monad:
Property x : Async<'a>
get : unit -> Async<'a>
set : Async<'a> -> unit
IndexedProperty x : 'k -> Async<'v>
get : 'k -> Async<'v>
set : 'k -> Async<'v> -> 'unit
This is what I would like to see made possible:
type Id<'a> = 'a
Property x : Async<'a>
get : unit -> Async<'a>
set : 'a -> Async<unit>
IndexedProperty x : 'k -> Async<'v>
get : 'k -> Async<'v>
set : 'k -> 'v -> Async<unit>

Interesting, could you post a snippet illustrating how the current syntax/typechecking is insufficient, and how this suggestion would make it better?

I am very sympathetic to this proposal. However, please note that the items would likely not be "proper" .NET properties since those are required to have "unit" return type on the setter method.
