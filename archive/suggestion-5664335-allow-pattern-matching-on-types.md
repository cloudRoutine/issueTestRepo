I'm deserializing into abitrary record types and need to parse the deserialized values into appropriate types for the constructor. I'd like to do:
match parameterInfo.ParameterType with
| typeof<int> -> parseInt (attributes.[key]) :> obj
| typeof<string> -> attributes.[key]) :> obj
...etc
Unfortunately, this doesn't compile. A (somewhat messy) workaround is:
match parameterInfo.ParameterType with
| x when x = typeof<int> -> parseInt (attributes.[key]) :> obj
| x when x = typeof<string> -> attributes.[key]) :> obj
...etc.

Declining per my comments, and also the comments from Craig. IMHO there is an adequate workaround for this that is clear, even if a little more explicit.

My feeling is that the "x = ..." is adequate - this makes it clear that what's really going on is an equality check.
Adding typeof<...> as a pattern may lead to false expectations that you can do things like "typeof<list<_>>" to match any list type.

You could easily make an active patten for this.

Richard, I considered an active pattern, but it seemed less readable than the workaround above, insofar as it at least includes the real type, typeof<int>, instead of a wrapper for same.
Don's question is interesting. Should that work? I can see arguments both for and against.

My serialization library does a lot of this to dissect values. I tried using active patterns but you quickly run out of 7 choices when you're looking at byte, char, int, float, decimal, string, arrays, lists, sets, maps and dictionaries. So I used a union type with "System.Type"s in it to perform one level of dissection via a separate function. Then you can match over the available types easily.

I agree with Don, but only because this instance isn't an extremely reoccurring one.
I also agree it would be nice to have this feature though.

Travis Brown pointed out tonight (on Twitter) that this feature, which is available in Scala, is "too easy" and is widely abused. I tend to agree, especially in a hybrid language with OO features. I still think it's the right answer for the specific example I gave, but I do agree the potential for abuse is high. I'm not sure how to rectify those two, conflicting opinions.

typeof<> and typedefof<> are constants for non-generics. This fact alone should make them available as match targets. To keep form with F#, perhaps uppercased versions could be coined: TypeOf and TypeDefOf, respectively. In any event, the present work around breaks simplicity. The types in a program are a constant finite set.
