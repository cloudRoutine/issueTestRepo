.Net 4.5 has a new type IReadOnlyCollection<'T> and list<'T> (a.k.a. FSharpList<'T>) fits this interface precisely, so I think it should implement it.

This is approved for inclusion in a future release of the F# core library subject to an implementation.
A pull request to implement this feature will be necessary and we encourage contributors to submit one with adequate design detail and testing to http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp.
Discussion of the particular version where this is included can be started once an implementation is available.

Workaround:
module List =
let asReadOnlyList (this: _ list) =
{ new System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<_> with
member x.GetEnumerator() = (this :> _ seq).GetEnumerator()
member x.GetEnumerator() = (this :> System.Collections.IEnumerable).GetEnumerator()
member x.Count = this.Length
member x.Item with get i = this.[i] }

nice work-around Mauricio

This seems entirely reasonable (we really should have done it n the FSharp.Core 4.4.0.0 revision)
