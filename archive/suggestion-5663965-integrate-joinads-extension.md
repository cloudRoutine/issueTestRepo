I’ve discussed this with Tomas today and he agreed it’s best to mark this as “declined” for now.
It wasn’t too political! Honest!!!! :)

You can try joinads here: http://tryjoinads.org/
It's already done, and from what I can tell seems to work great! What's holding this one back?

Joinads extend the computation expressions with the match! keyword to give control over the pattern matching to the underlying builder.
let putString = Channel<string>()
let putInt = Channel<int>()
let getString = ReplyChannel<string>()
join {
match! getString, putString, putInt with
| repl, v, ? -> repl.Reply("Echo " + v)
| repl, ?, v -> repl.Reply("Echo " + (string v)) }
It becomes more and more useful for reactive applications and frameworks like Orleans, Akka.net and Rx extensions, to implement flexible pattern matching on messages.
Applicative functors add 'let! x = xs and y =ys' and 'for x in xs and y in ys do ...' and enable to build zip semantic over computation expressions that can also prove useful in reactive applications, computations on time series, and much more:
let totalPrice =
timeseries {
for p in unitPrice
and q in quantity
yield p * q
Both have been implemented for F# 3.0 open source on Tomas Petricek and my research branch:
https://github.com/tpetricek/fsharp/commits/research
https://github.com/thinkbeforecoding/fsharp/commits/research
a first implementation based on F# 2.0 can be tested at http://tryjoinads.org/

I'm with Richard here - I too wonder what's holding this one back?

I don't know why this has not been incorporated.

I think it is tricky to prove it correct and this is not a small change. although I am not quite informed. concurrent programming is really valuable though.

Would it be simpler to only support active patterns than can return `Choice` but wrapped in a type? For example:
let (|Left|Right|) (a:Async<'a>, b:Async<'b>) = async {
let! first,second = Async.choose (Choice1Of2 a) (Choice2Of2 b)
match first with
| Choice1Of2 a -> return Left a
| Choice2Of2 b -> return Right b
}
and use like:
match! a,b with
| Left a ->
| Right b ->

I would guess that it might be internal politics within the F# team which might be holding this back. I do not know for sure though.

I think my position on joinads is fairly well known. The proposal is most definitely interesting from a research language design perspective.
However the typical "bang for buck" tradeoff analysis just doesn't convince me that this should be in F# itself.


## Comment by Dax Fohl on 6/18/2016 10:20:00 PM
@DonSyme Your position is not well-known in the larger F# world, which is actually quite large now. Can you comment more about where you see the "bang" and the "buck"? I see some potentially useful ideas from tomasp's blogs, but not sure where the buck lands. Does it kill compiler time, or...?
