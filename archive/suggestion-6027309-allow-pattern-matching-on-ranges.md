It would be quite useful to allow pattern matching on ranges as in the following:
let find x =
match x with
| 42 -> "aaa"
| 150 .. 180 -> "bbb"
| 222 .. 333 -> "ccc"
| _ -> "zzz"
While one can use guards or active patterns to provide equivalent functionality, it would be quite useful and result in cleaner code if pattern matching on ranges was natively supported.

I’m declining this because a general mechanism (active patterns) already exists that achieves the desired result. In F# 2.0 we decided to add the more general mechanism and remove special cases such as character range patterns (present in OCaml).
Language design is always a tradeoff, and adding new special syntactic cases for this case doesn’t seem appropriate. For example, we would have to consider ranges of other types including floating point numbers, decimals, user-defined numeric literals etc.
