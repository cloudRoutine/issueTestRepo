This is a huge pain in developing type providers.
Maybe it's possible to use the same strategy used for FSI recently?

Declined per comment below â€“ this belongs in Microsoft\visualfsharp or FSharp.Compiler.Service

Do you have problems debugging TPs in an Experimental VS instance?

It forces you to keep closing and reopening the second VS instance, which is very time consuming.
Additionally, this means that you can't keep the project and the tests in the same solution. For example, in FSharp.Data, if I'm changing anything which is actually not even related to TPs, I have to build, open the test solution, build and run the tests, then close that second solution to be able to do more changes. It completely kills anything even remotely close to TDD

What is Experimental VS?

I'm closing this in the F# Language User Voice because it's a Visual Studio or FSharp.Compiler.Service issue. Please raise a bug in those repos.
