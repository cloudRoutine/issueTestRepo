# Idea 7745940: Allow types to behave also like modules. #

I find this kind of coding annoying
module Foo =
type T = { a:int, b:int }
let xxx t = t.a
let yyy t = t.b

it would be much more compact and have less noise in the type system to allow
type Foo =
{ a:int, b:int }
with
let xxx t = t.a
let yyy t = t.b
So you can do
{ a = 10; b = 20 } | Foo.xxx

The following works:
type Foo =
{ a:int; b:int }
with
static member xxx t = t.a
static member yyy t = t.b

As pointed out below, adding static members to types is close to what you want.
