Allow the declaration of named constraints that can have other named constraints nested within them and are resolved at runtime or compile time based on their structure , e.g.
constraint (^a:eatsDrinksSleeps) =
when ^a : equality
and ^a : comparison
and ^a : (static member Hungry: bool)
and ^a : (member chews: string -> bool)
and ^a : (member drinks: float -> bool)
and ^a : (member sleepsFor: float with get,set)
let inline go_wild (beast:^a when ^a: eatsDrinksSleeps) = ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They could also be defined on flexible types that take generic parameters -
constraint (#seq<'a> : greatData) =
when 'a: struct
and 'a: comparison
and 'a: equality
let calc (col:'a when 'a:greatData) = ....

Thanks for the suggestion. It is entirely reasonable and it’s taken me a long time to mark it as declined. I’ve listed the reasons below – and [/archive/suggestion-5762135-support-for-type-classes-or-implicits](/archive/suggestion-5762135-support-for-type-classes-or-implicits.md) can be used as a placeholder for requests in the type-class/constraint area

Related suggestion: [/archive/suggestion-8393964-interfaces-as-simple-reusable-and-named-sets-of-m?tracking_code=bd9d860150afdb439a2ef3ab649e0374](/archive/suggestion-8393964-interfaces-as-simple-reusable-and-named-sets-of-m?tracking_code=bd9d860150afdb439a2ef3ab649e0374.md)
The advantage of that suggestion is that it simplifies the syntax of explicit member constraints, does not require a new keyword (albeit a new operator) and can reuse existing interfaces and its syntax.

This gist shows how to name collections of member constraints today: https://gist.github.com/dsyme/bfed2eed788c7ba58ccc

Because it is already possible to name sets of constraints using the technique below, I am going to decline this request. Also the request [/archive/suggestion-5762135-support-for-type-classes-or-implicits](/archive/suggestion-5762135-support-for-type-classes-or-implicits.md) is overlapping and can be used to cover the general suggestion to have a trait/constraint/type-class facility in the language

Don, in your gist, you can't use the members without restating the constraints, what the point?
I think Jared was after something like this:
let inline go_wild (beast:^a when ^a: eatsDrinksSleeps) =
(* *) beast.chews "snack"
(* *) beast.drinks "potion"
(* *) if not beast.Hungry then printfn "BURP!"
not something which force to state the constraint in a cryptic way at each usage of beast.

Thanks Don for sharing the Gist but unfortunately the type alias trick does not solve the problem for purely static member constraints. In the following example for instance I want to express the same set of constraints for both ^T1 and ^T2 without having to repeat them.
type Combine< ^T1,^ T2 when
^T1 : (static member print : string -> unit)
and ^T1 : (static member flush : unit -> unit)
and ^T2 : (static member print : string -> unit)
and ^T2 : (static member flush : unit -> unit)
> =
static member inline printAndFlushBoth m =
(^T1:(static member print : string -> unit) m)
(^T2:(static member print : string -> unit) m)
(^T1:(static member flush : unit -> unit) ())
(^T2:(static member flush : unit -> unit) ())
Following your gist I could define a type alias encoding the two constraints (write and flush) but my constraints being entirely static I have no way to refer to the type alias it in a type annotation since there exist no variable of static type.
Another benefit of named constraints is that the 'comparison' and 'equality' constraints could be defined in the F# core library instead of being hard-coded in the language.
Do you have another trick up your sleeve for the above example? If not, would you consider reopening this suggestion?
