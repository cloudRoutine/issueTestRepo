It would be very useful to be able to pass lists, arrays, options, tuples as static parameters to type providers. Something like this:
type Foo = FooProvider<files = ["file1.txt"; "file2.txt"]>
Note that this is different from [/archive/suggestion-5675977-allow-type-providers-to-generate-types-from-other](/archive/suggestion-5675977-allow-type-providers-to-generate-types-from-other.md) which is about taking *types* as parameter; this is about taking *values* of a few specific predefined types, which should be much simpler as it doesn't need staged compilation.

I am going to decline this. If we did something more in this area it would be to allow System.Type and arbitrary quotation expressions to be passed as arguments. These are covered by [/archive/suggestion-8306538-allow-quotations-of-expressions-used-as-type-provi](/archive/suggestion-8306538-allow-quotations-of-expressions-used-as-type-provi.md) and [/archive/suggestion-5675977-allow-type-providers-to-generate-types-from-other](/archive/suggestion-5675977-allow-type-providers-to-generate-types-from-other.md)
