please provide a simplified way to work with mutable discriminated union values similar to the simplified announcement [1].
The current scheme depends upon the ref keyword. It would be nice to replace ref with mutable, and then be able to use the cleaner <- operator rather than :=. This would then be more consistent for folk who get used to the "it just works" syntax (see [1]).
Instead of:
type AST = | Keyword of string ref
let theDuValue = AST.Keyword (ref "test")
let (Keyword(v)) = theDuValue in v := "new value"
we could have:
type AST = | Keyword of mutable string
let theDUValue = AST.Keyword ("test")
let (Keyword(v)) = theDUValue in v <- "new value"
It's a slightly contrived example, but this syntax does have has its uses.
An example in ref form from Microsoft.FSharp.Compiler (file: tast.fs)
TraitConstraintInfo =
| TTrait of TTypes * string * MemberFlags * TTypes * TType option * TraitConstraintSln option ref
member x.Solution
with get() = (let (TTrait(_,_,_,_,_,sln)) = x in sln.Value)
and set v = (let (TTrait(_,_,_,_,_,sln)) = x in sln.Value <- v)
Note: TraitConstraintSln uses the option type. The "<-" here has nothing to do with a simplified syntax

I think it's best to just define a settable property on the DU that does what you want.
