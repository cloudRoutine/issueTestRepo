Instead of writing:
async {
let! m fetch_something()
match m with
| ...
}
it would be nice to write
async {
match! fetch_something() with
| ...
}

Is this different from Joinads?

@Anonymous - yes, it is different (and much simpler)

Nice.

Yes, this consistent with the other keywords.

We considered this in the F# language design but declined it, partly because of the possibility to reserve the syntax for the joinad feature.
If we did something in this area it would probably be to allow an "await" or "bind" at any point in the non-higher-order (non-lambda) control-flow structure of an F# expression, for particular kinds of computation expressions which support rewriting to a local CPS style. However that is a larger feature than the one proposed here.
