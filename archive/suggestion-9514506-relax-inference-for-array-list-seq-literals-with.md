See here for some context: http://websharper.com/question/80117/allow-doc-element-to-take-seq-doc-children
Currently, if the context decides that a given array/list/seq literal has type seq<#T> (for example if it is passed to a function that expects that), then the exact subtype of T is decided by the first element of the sequence, and if any subsequent element is more general then it is a type error. It would be nice if the type could be generalized instead.
Example:
type Animal() = class end
type Dog() = inherit Animal()
let feed (animals: seq<#Animal>) = ()
// Type error on `Animal()`: expected Dog, got Animal
feed [ Dog(); Animal() ]

Per my comment, the example works if you drop the use of # flexibility in this case

This is my biggest pain when interfacing with other (class based) libraries in F#.
It makes almost impossible to write even the lightest functional wrapper around such libraries. except one start to wrap all child classes into distinct union value constructors.

I will mark this particular request as declined because it's not entirely clear what is being proposed here. Please reopen with a more concrete suggestion and lots of examples? I understand there is pain in this area but we need further motivating examples.
Thanks!
