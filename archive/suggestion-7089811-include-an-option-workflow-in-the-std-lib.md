An Option workflow/monad is incredibly useful when working with Options, and a common enough pattern that it should be provided by default rather than in third party libraries.

The current design position is that this is best done in community libraries. However I'd be interested in further feedback about whether this should be in FSharp.Core

I propose to decline this since I'm basically OK with this being in user code or in a community library, rather than in FSharp.Core.
