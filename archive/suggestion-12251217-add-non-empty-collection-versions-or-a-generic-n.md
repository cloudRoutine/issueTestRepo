A class of empty collection bugs and checking code could be eliminated if there was standard library support for non-empty collections.
In a similar way to the option type it would make function signatures more explicit.

Our approach is that this doesn't need to be in the core library - you can define such a collection yourself. There are a lot of constrained types that could go in the F# core library, adding them to the core library would expand out the library surface area too much.
