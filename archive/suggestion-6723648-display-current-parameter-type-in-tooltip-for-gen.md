I posted this on CodePlex (https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/workitem/172), and Don Syme asked me to put it here as well.
The C# editor in Visual Studio displays the actual parameter types involved in the tooltips for generic class instances and method invocations. The F# editor only does that for objects and methods, but oddly not for F# types/functions; shouldn't this information be quite readily available?
Having this kind of information at hand would especially make it quite a bit easier to follow the transformation of data through pipe chains, even more so as this type of display is also completely absent for lambdas at this time.

Not really a language item, but this should be implemented in the Visual F# Tools and the F# COmpiler Service

I don't understand this feature request. Could you please elaborate or provide a code sample?

This should really go in the Visual Studio Tools user voice. But it's important to do, we should just get it done :)
