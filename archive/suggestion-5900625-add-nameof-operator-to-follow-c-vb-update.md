The Roslyn compiler currently (as of 2014-05-08) has a new NameOf operator listed as "Planned" for both C# and VB:
(https://roslyn.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Language%20Feature%20Status&referringTitle=Documentation)
Pending its arrival there, it would be awesome to get something similar in F# as well.

I agree this should be added to F#.
The exact design needs nailing down. A special library intrinsic "val nameof : 'T -> string" looks appropriate, where "T" can be either an expression, a first-class use of a method or a typeof<...> expression may be simplest. The check.fs and opt.fs in the F# compiler would then treat this construct as special, doing a compile-time evaluation.
https://gist.github.com/forki/7c8ef4c3126c953630fb shows the kind of place where this is used in C#.

I have a prototype implementation. Will send a first pull request for discussion soon.

This is adding the name at compile-time right?

Would really like this feature. Currently I have some ugly code with a hardcoded string in F# which I would like to improve. A nameof would make the code much safer against refactorings.
[<ReflectedDefinition(true)>]
let foo (x) = ...
let fooType = foo.GetType().DeclaringType.GetMethod("foo")
let fooExpr = Expr.TryGetReflectedDefinition(fooType)

Allowing my suggested function extension or macros would allow this implementation to be trivial. I explain this again below:
-----
So what would be nice is to extend the resolution of function parameters so that they wrap their parameters to be quotation expressions if it is a macro definition. Otherwise it would pass in the direct object value as normal. We can introduce a new keyword to make the distinction.
The definition of it could look like:
// def is a let that will pass in arguments as a Quotations.Expr
def nameof (arg:Quotations.Expr) : string = match arg with | Quotations.Patterns.Let(v, e1,e2) -> v.Name | expr -> expr.ToString()
let y = 1
printfn "%s" (nameof y)
The boxing will just find the most local definition of parameter if it is a variable or wrap the expression directly as <@ expression @>
This could allow us to use a lot of existing code and framework already in F#
