In order to be able to write code that you can easily consume that does not throw an exception have a fsharp core type with the following signature:
type Result<'TSuccess,'TError> =
| Success of 'TSuccess
| Error of 'TError
from

Completed. The RFC is here: https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/blob/master/RFCs/FS-1004-result-type.md

There's already an isomorphic type in FSharp.Core : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee353439.aspx .
I'd say error handling through discriminated unions belongs to the user lib area, e.g. FSharpx, Chessie, etc.

I really like this model and believe it is useful enough to warrant inclusion in the language. Note the inclusion in other languages (e.g. Rust).
This model - specifically returning a success result (of varying type) or an error result (of a single type) - lends itself extremely well to the computation expression:
let resultOrError = result {
let! result1 = thingThatMayFail1()
let! result2 = thingThatMayFail2 result1
return result2 }
match resultOrError with
| Success x -> ... // proceed along success path
| Failure e -> ... //handle error
The expected behavior of this computation expression is fairly clear (at least to me), and it would be nice not to have to include a file or library to use it in all my projects (and I do use it all the time).

In balance I think adding this type to FSharp.Core would be a good thing. Using Choice has obvious problems in clarity
One thing I wonder is if it should wait until a struct-union feature is available so the type could be a struct.

What kind of testing would you like to be done?
Perhaps some example usage?
The obvious construct to also expose would be something like
Result.Try : (unit->'T1) -> Result<'T1, Exception>
as can be seen in Chessie:
https://github.com/fsprojects/Chessie/blob/master/src/Chessie/ErrorHandling.fs#L29
and in rust:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/#the-try-macro
however, "Try" collides with a .net keyword, so it not be ok to use.

Yep, having struct union for this would be even more awsome

Create F# RFC 1004 ( https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/blob/master/RFCs/FS-1004-result-type.md )
Please continue discussion in https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/issues/49
