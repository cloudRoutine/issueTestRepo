Currently Code Contracts doesn't work in F# properly, especially in the primary contructors. Although F# is null safe and functional , I still find code contracts for the public surface of the projects.

I’m supportive of this if we can identify what’s needed.
Please provide more details about what would need to change with F# to make code contracts work, and reopen a new suggestion for each necessary change.
Thanks
Don

This is surely a request for the Code Contracts feature team at Microsoft. What needs to change for F# to make this work?
thanks

Don,
Code Contracts are almost working with F# as in C# (besides IDE support) except one thing. The F# constructors. If we put Contract.Requires inside a constructor, then Code Contracts complains this/me cannot be used inside a constructor regerdless of primary or secondary ctor. Maybe this is all code contracts fault. I just wish someone from F# team contacted to Code Contracts for a resolution or vice versa

Have a look at WhyML (link on http://why3.lri.fr/) as ML is very much close to F#.

Don, F# compiler does a lot of magic. Especially if we put Contract.Requires to the beginning of a method or a constructor, F# can (if it is a constructor it will) put additional code.
There is nothing code contract team can do anything about this because this is about how F# compiler works. It basically adds code to the prologue methods and ctors. What compiler can do is to respect System.Diagnostics.Contract class and don't put any code above it.
