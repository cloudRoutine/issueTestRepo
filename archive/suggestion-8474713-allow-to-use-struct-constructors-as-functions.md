Similar to the suggestion [Allow to use class constructors as functions]([/archive/suggestion-5663317-allow-to-use-class-constructors-as-functions),](/archive/suggestion-5663317-allow-to-use-class-constructors-as-functions),.md) it would be nice if we use constructors of structs as functions.

I double checked and this is implemented in F# 4.0, see https://gist.github.com/dsyme/f07a195a5f0f412b34ec
Please link to a gist if there are cases that are not covered by this.
