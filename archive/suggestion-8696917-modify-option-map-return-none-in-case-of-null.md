Java 8's methods on Optional return None in case any operation yields null. Case in point is Optional.map.
Assume that a Session type has a User property that could be null. The following should return None instead of Some(null):
Some(app) |> Option.map (fun a -> a.Session)
The use case is when interoperating with C#, where nulls are more common.

That would break the functor law "fmap id = id". Java can sort of get away with it (though I haven't seen any formal analysis of this) because you can't construct the equivalent of Some(null), but as we know that's not the case in F#.

I see. I didn't think about the algebraic laws. I was coming from Java 8 in which their Optional type does handle null by converting it to a None (or Empty, in Java parlance). F#'s new Option.ofObj() is probably sufficient.
Also, my apologies for my code sample in the original post. I was working with some sample code in which you could walk the property tree this way:
app.Session.User.Name
I accidentally posted the app.Session code snippet instead of the session.User snippet. My apologies for being confusing.

The current behaviour is appropriate for F# - if the type being returned has null as a true value - or even an abnormal value - then we preserve that.

Here's an article explaining in detail what I briefly mentioned in my previous comment: https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/08/optional-broken/
