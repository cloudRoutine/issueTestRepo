Rather than:
printfn "%i %x %A" mySecretNumber mySecretNumber mySecretNumber
Perhaps an index argument could be added
printfn "%[1]i %[1]x %[1]A" mySecretNumber

Dave, do you think that would still be useful with making your variable name short in the scope where you want to print it:
do
(**)let n = mySecretNumber
(**)printfn "%i %x %A" n n n
I think it is interesting idea (but with a 0 based index and robust compiler checks) but maybe not as useful as string interpolation?

I currently use a short variable if I can to reduce the annoyance, but forcing myself to use bad variable names is not good practice either. It seems there should be a way to reuse a binding rather than repeating yourself.

Dave, can you show how mixed of positional and indexed arguments would play together?
Should we reuse string.format notation with braces?

Hello,
So if you have the following (0 indexed):
printfn "%A %A[0] %A" a b c
printfn "%A %A[1] %A" a b c
printfn "%A %A %A" a b c
printfn "%A %A %A[1]" a b c
The first and fourth would seem to be a compiler error and the second and third should be okay. It seems like subtle errors can easily creep in that may not be obvious with a quick eye scan. How can this be made more clear or is it better to cancel this in favor the following:
