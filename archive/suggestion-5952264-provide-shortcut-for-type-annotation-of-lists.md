I suggest to provide a shortcut syntax ( `[<typname>]` ) for type annotation of F# Lists. Instead of this-
let upto (a:int): int list = [1..a]
I want to have-
let upto (a:int): [int] = [1..a]
Then list of list of int will be `[[int]]` instead of `int list list`. When type gets complex, we tend to use more brackets for clarity like- `(int list) list`. This proposed annotation should reduce some verbosity maintaining clarity. As in F#, `[..]` is already associated with lists, I am for using this in type also.

My feeling is that this is not appropriate for F#, given the existiing availability of "int[]" for arrays.
