Large data projects require lots of records with 100+ fields. These records require small changes over time, e.g. a new field is added. To update the data the old records are read in and copied to the new record field by field. The proposal is to automatically copy fields from an old record of type A to a new record of Type B where both the field names and the field types match.
type A = {x : int}
type B = {x : int; y : int}
let a : A = {x = 1}
let b : B = {a with y = 2}

I'd extend this idea to also make it easier to *create* records of different types.
type A = {x: int}
type B = {A with y:int}

This is very much related to [/archive/suggestion-5663704-copy-and-update-on-class-types](/archive/suggestion-5663704-copy-and-update-on-class-types.md)
I will close this suggestion in favour of that one and link back here
