I find it really elegant in some language where predicate functions can end with a question mark.
Consider `odd? 5` vs `isOdd 5` or `areRelated a b` vs `related? a b`
There might be some reason why it's a terrible idea grammar-wise or something in F#. I'm still very much a newbie I'm afraid. I apologize if it's featured in a FAQ I missed or even here and I search badly.

You can get this to work with backtick declarations which let you put lots of stuff e.g. spaces in the declaration e.g.
let ``odd?`` a = a % 2 <> 0
Intellisense in e.g. Visual Studio doesn't work for them though, unfortunately.
