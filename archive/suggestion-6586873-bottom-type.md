Bottom type
Bottom type for all types. Allows you to implement usefull functions like unimplemented (see scala ???)

This is definitely better than e.g. failwith, which returns an 'a instead of a bottom type, which would be more appropriate.

We may introduce a new [<NoReturn>] attribute, borrowed from GCC, and mark functions such as Environment.Exit with it.
Cf. https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html

I'm not really familiar with Scala, but I like what I understand of the ??? construct, so lately I've been using this in F#:
[<GeneralizableValue>]
let TODO<'a> : 'a = raise (NotImplementedException())
which lets me write TODO whereever I'm not ready to supply an implementation. Would a bottom type provide benefit beyond this?

We considered this for F# 1.0 but decided to stick to the OCaml way of just using a type variable. We won't revisit that decision at this point
