Because WinRT is a Windows-only, Microsoft-only interoperabiliity feature, it seems this suggestion is best categorized as a Microsoft Visual F# Tools team support for F#.
This user voice is about the F# language itself.
Please move this suggestion to the Visual F# Tools user voice here: http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/category/30935-languages-f-tools
