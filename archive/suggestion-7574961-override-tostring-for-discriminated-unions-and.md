It's a pain and dirty to add `override x.ToString() = sprintf "%A" x` to every type in order to make `String.Format()` happy:
type T1 =
{ Id: int
Version: string }
override x.ToString() = sprintf "%A" x
type DU =
| C1 of int
| C2
override x.ToString() = sprintf "%A" x
I think it's very easy to teach the compiler generate this override automatically for all user types.

Marking as planned, though we need to work out the details

This is a real world issue and a problem in projects like paket or https://github.com/adamchester/EaToSql/blob/master/src/EaToSql/Model.fs

Also it's hard to debug such types without the automatic tostring implementation. Debugger just shows the type name.

However, %A is very very slow, ideally the implementation should not do any reflection at runtime, but be based on code generated at compile time.

I am against this. ToString() carries no semantics. To what kind of string? Is it an atomic value or structured value? Is it for logging or display to the user? There is no consistency. The ToString() method should simply be deprecated.
You can always simply call sprintf "%A" any structural type to get a good structured representation even if its very slow.
