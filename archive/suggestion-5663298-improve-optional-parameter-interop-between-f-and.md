It would be nice if the F# compiler automatically inserted [<Optional;DefaultParameterValue(null)>] in all optional parameters of methods declared in F# classes, so they would be easier to use from C#
It would also be nice if the constructors of records also used this for parameters of type Option<_>

This proposal is “approved in principle” for F# 4.x+
If you would like to submit an implementation and testing, please submit to the appropriate branch of http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp. See http://fsharp.github.io/2014/06/18/fsharp-contributions.html for details about contributing to the F# language and core library
