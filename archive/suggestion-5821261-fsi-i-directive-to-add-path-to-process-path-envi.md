If a managed assembly that uses native DLLs with p/invoke is referenced in F# Interactive using #r and #I directives, using them may fail with a DllNotFoundException even if the native assembly is in the same folder as the managed one and the folder has been included using the #I directive. Note that it is not possible to reference native DLLs explicitly in .Net.
Suggestion: make the #I directive automatically add the specified path also to the process-local Path environment variable, this way it would help not only resolving managed but also native assemblies.
Windows only; loading libraries is quite different in Linux.

It seems you can work around this by adding to the path manually. I think I would prefer to keep that as the solution rather than making implicit changes to the path.
