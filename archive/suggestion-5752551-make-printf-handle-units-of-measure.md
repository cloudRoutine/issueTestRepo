# Idea 5752551: Make printf handle units of measure. #

Currently printf requires all numeric types with units of measure to have the units removed. For example:
let years = 1<year>
printfn "%d" years // compile error
printfn "%d" (int years) // works
This gets quite ugly in code that uses units of measure heavily.

printf could even take advantage of the presence of the measure. We could imagine something like:
[<Measure>]
[<MeasurePrintFormat(" meters")>]
type meter
let distance = 3<meter>
printfn "The distance is %d" distance // Prints: The distance is 3 meters

This was definitely needed. I love Loic's idea of being able to specify the print format of measures.
