mapi allows us to map a collection using not just the items in the collection but also the index of each item.
Could we do something similar with filter?
let nums = [0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7]
let atEvenPos = List.filteri (fun i x -> i%2=0) nums
Result
atEvenPos = [0; 2; 4; 6]

Declined per my comment below â€“ using Seq.indexed is enough in F# 4.0, though if necessary the user can write fresh functions explicitly.

Combining this with [/archive/suggestion-6368913-add-array-foralli](/archive/suggestion-6368913-add-array-foralli.md) to cover both "filteri" and "foralli"

In F# 4.0 we added List/Array/Seq.indexed, that's enough to satisfy the most common use cases for these without exploding the range of possible functions.
