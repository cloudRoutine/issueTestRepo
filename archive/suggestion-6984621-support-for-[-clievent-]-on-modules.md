As the name suggests. You can create [<CLIEvent>]s on classes as both instance and static members but not on a module. As far as the consuming e.g. C# library, the fact we're using a module in F# is unknown; from the F# side it's a pity you have to create classes for this behaviour rather than more idiomatic modules.

Hi Isaac, my feeling is that requiring a class is consistent with the F# language design. CLIEvent is an object-programming feature - like properties, abstract members etc.

Also, static events are rare in design.

Understood. Perhaps a warning or error would be preferable to what you currently get though, which kind of falls between both options i.e. it compiles but generates something unexpected.
