Maybe make it optional?
Otherwise it is more verbose than C#.

I personally like the current syntax.

Should be optional, not removed (otherwise code will break).
And I'm all for it.
It happens to me countless of times that I forget it because my mind just always expects better.

Seems like it would complicate the language a lot to make it optional. If we were starting from scratch though I'd support it. I would like to hear about what the reasoning behind requiring "fun" for lambda's. Was it simply because it was in OCAML? or was there other technical reasons?

I agree, it looks horrible. C# has a much better lambda syntax, imho.
Potentially we could use Haskell's backslash:
[1;2;3] |> Seq.map (\x -> x * x)
Although it ain't as perfect like C#'s, it would work without making the language ambiguous.

I really like the fun keyword.

Would certainly improve our code golf scores a little! :-)

I think it would be nice if we could write anonymous functions like expressions. The compiler could tell it is a function based on undeclared variables being used.
(fun x y -> x + y)
(x + y)

I agree that it is too long and actually moving to C# syntax would be reasonable.
However current syntax allows to introduce a snippet for lambda that looks natural
Type fun, press tab (or just space in case of CodeRush) and fun is almost ready for you.

You wanna take the fun out of F#!
It is not always needed. Often you can write ((+) y) instead of (fun x -> x + y). For other cases I have a R# live template expansion, which just adds me an arrow and braces, defined like here:
fsfun ==> (fun x -> $END$)
However it would be nice to map list of pairs like in Scala: List.map (_ + _)

I think we should preserve the fun keyword to be backward compatible, however
I really like the Elixir shorthand lambda expressions:
1..100_000 |> Enum.map(&(&1 * 3)) |> Enum.filter(odd?) |> Enum.sum
You can for example make
fun x y z -> x + y + z
into
&(&1 + &2 + &3)
it is not that much shorter, but it frees the programmer from thinking about what to name all those pesky variables.. just like the pipeline frees the programmer from making up a lot of variable names...

to some Anonymous: variable names are important
if you are lazy enough to name variables $1 $2 $3 then just name them a b c - it is even shorter.
Besides, names do matter for maintainability. 2-3 months from now, nobody will know what the original programmer indented to do - names help.
On topic: It would be so cool to get rid of the 'fun' keyword and make lambdas as sexy as those in C#. However, I doubt it is possible due to statement evaluation logic of F# and ambiguity that would arise without some arbitrary discriminator for lambda expression.
In C# lambdas are clear from the context and I am not sure F# context is rich enough to get by without the 'fun' keyword but maybe it is - would be awesome.

I like what we currently have. It isn't that much more verbose than C#. In a way, it seems easier to spot out lambdas in a codebase when you see 'fun'.

I agree with Mastr Mastic, instead of removing it to make it optional.
Something else that could also be made optional is the let keyword.

In response to those who enjoy typing fun, and seeing fun, I do not think the language maintainers would break existing code. The reasonable way to interpret the requirement is to interpret it as optional. I personally think this might be nice. I'm sure there is a clean way to make this work. I would personally prefer the => syntax if possible, simply because many many languages currently use that, including C#.


## Comment by Mohsin Syed on 9/15/2016 2:48:00 PM
looks verbose. Removing would make lambda looks cleaner.

I think the optional use of the fun keyword would be the way to go as well. Just like in React in ES6 the function keyword is no longer necessary
