DU case constructors can be used as standalone functions, which means I can use them in partial application:
x |> List.map Some
The same isn't currently allowed on class constructors:
x |> List.map Uri
For this examples is not a problem, but in some real life scenarios is annoying to have to create wrapper functions

This is now completed and available in preview releases of F# 4.0.
For an early Visual Studio preview release see here (cross platform releases will follow) â€“ http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fsharpteam/archive/2014/11/12/announcing-a-preview-of-f-4-0-and-the-visual-f-tools-in-vs-2015.aspx

Yes, this would be very useful. Strange that you can "|> set" for a set but you have to do "|> fun kvs -> Map kvs" for a Map.

Curious to know how difficult it would be to extend efforts in this area to allow DUs with "multiple argument" work like Haskell and spare us the need for a tuple? I feel this latter feature is even more useful than the former, esp. with respect to pattern matching.

I think this is a reasonable idea, one thing I've done in the past is to make a factory function with the same name as the class in the same module. This seems to work fairly well (if my memory serves).

An implementation of this feature has now been submitted here: https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/dsyme/cleanup/contribution/7104

Note that after this change, the names "Set" and "Map can be used, since they are type names in an auto-opened part of the FSharp.Core library, for example:
let f3() = ["a"] |> Set
let f4() = [("a", 4); ("b", 5) ] |> Map
This is quite regular.
However this does raise the question as to whether the pervasive function "set" (lower case) should be deprecated: it's precisely the same as the above. It is better to have only one way to do things.

Will it also work when there's more than one param and/or multiple overloads?
The lower case set (and possible other similar functions) will become redundant, but that shouldn't be a big deal IMHO. There's other things that are way more annoying (like partial application unfriendly param order on Array.get, defaultArg and others because of ocaml compat).
I wouldn't deprecate as it's probably used a lot
