It will be excellent to have string interpolation with intellisense support as opposed to the anacronical printf variants.
Syntax may be:
let a = 40
let p = "John"
let b = $" ${p} has $(a*2) items"

Declining as [/archive/suggestion-6002107-steal-nice-println-syntax-from-swift](/archive/suggestion-6002107-steal-nice-println-syntax-from-swift.md) is close enough to act as a “duplicate”.

correction:
let b = $" $(p) has $(a*2) items"

-1 to this. I agree with Martin Odersky's argument in http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.debate/872 , this doesn't really save much typing. (even though Scala ended up getting string interpolation after that discussion).
Plus it's really easy to forget the interpolation symbol '$', and then you end up with the literal string "${p} has $(a*2) items", this has happened to me many times while programming in Scala.
Alternatively, one could implement this as a type provider, which isn't as terse but it's explicit about the variables being passed and could do strict type checking.

I'm also -1 for this as it cannot be partially applied.

Similar suggestion but restricted to printf only [/archive/suggestion-6002107-steal-nice-println-syntax-from-swift](/archive/suggestion-6002107-steal-nice-println-syntax-from-swift.md)
