I just want to click, drag and move files around in the solution explorer. As of today I have to unload my solution, edit my fsproj file and move on. How in the world do you do enterprise development like this?

Since this is about the Visual F# Tools (rather than the F# language) this belongs at https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/category/30935-languages-f-tools
Please add an entry there or vote on an existing one.
Your feedback is most welcome though!
Thanks!

You can use Visual F# Power Tools to create folders and moves files between them.
Why do you think enterprise development is different from others that it requires folders a lot? I find neediness of folders very rarely.

Even though power tools enable folder creation (except the problem of unique names), the ability to move files with easy dragn'drop would be a nice feature. I've heard colleagues of mine complaining about this missing support.
