Often, I find myself writing little private modules to provide some syntactic sugar for a type that I'm using heavily in a file.
For instance, take this method for quoting an F# function into a LINQ Expression Tree from http://stackoverflow.com/a/23146624/578190. It would be nice if I could write it like this:
open System.Linq.Expressions
open module =
type Expression with
static member Lambda(e:Expression<_>) = e
The above construct would be equivalent to this:
module private SomeGeneratedNameIDontCareAbout =
type Expression with
static member Lambda(e:Expression<_>) = e
open SomeGeneratedNameIDontCareAbout
Note that the module is implicitly private; it effectively has no name, so there is no way to reference its members outside the scope in which it is open'd.
The `open module =` syntax is just my random suggestion :)

A colleague just pointed out that you can do this:
[<AutoOpen>]
module private __ =
...
Not quite as pretty, but adequate. Feeling a little silly, I withdraw my suggestion.
