Command line parameters for debugging are stored in the F# project file. This makes it hard to keep your commits clean.
My suggestion is to do the same as C#, where this information is stored in .csproj.user, which is not put in version control.
This doesn't really have anything to do with the language itself, but it *is* part of the package.

YES! Please do this.

This is really the Visual F# Tools, and not the F# language or core library.
Please move this to https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/category/30935-languages-f-tools. I think there is already a tracking item there.
Thanks!
Don

And ideally just make the submit fixes and tests to the Visual F# Tools code, what you request is entirely reasonable :)
