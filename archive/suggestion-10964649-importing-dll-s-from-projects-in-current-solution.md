It is currently a hassle to import references to DLL's from projects in the current solution because full paths has to be given and recursive dependencies have to be handled manually. Why not make it possible to import a "project" by name along with all dependencies into F# interactive.

Or at least remove the requirement that references be entered in dependency order to fsi. Error FS0074 is a big pain point for me in fsi, and there are numerous confused discussions about it on stackoverflow and github. I realize this may not be that easy, but it would be worth the effort!

This is implemented as "Send project references to F# Interactive" in Visual Studio, and I think may be available similarly in other F# tooling. So I will mark it as completed
In any case it is more on the tooling side than the language side.
