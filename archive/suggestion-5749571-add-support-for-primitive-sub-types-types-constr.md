Please add support for sub-types like Ada which are enforced by the F# compiler. A sub-type is basically just a sub-range of an existing primitive type like int.
This is extremely useful for domain modelling and makes code much more robust.
Examples using existing range syntax or existing for-loop syntax or :
//restrict range (specify min value and max value)
type percent = decimal for 0M to 1M //for-loop syntax
type positive_int = int in 1 .. int.MaxValue //range syntax
type non_negative_int = int for 0 to int.MaxValue //for-loop syntax
//a positive_int should be assignable to a non_negative_int
//specify minimum and maximum length of string
type path = string for 1 to 256 //for-loop syntax

Declined per my comment below: this feature almost immediately leads you to dependent types, see the comments here: [/archive/suggestion-6062821-add-dependent-types](/archive/suggestion-6062821-add-dependent-types.md)

Wouldn't dependent typing also solve this? If so then hopefully the work on F* could be used here.

Wish I could give more votes. Ever since I saw this in Ada I've always thought it would such a useful feature to have in F#. Certainly agree that it would enhance safety and robustness.

Just to note that this feature is very difficult to add to F# satisfactorily, and quickly leads you towards full dependent types.
