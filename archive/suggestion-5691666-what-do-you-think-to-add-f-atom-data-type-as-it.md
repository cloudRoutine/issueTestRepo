I think to implement Erlang like atoms can add language more readability more precise pattern matching. More here http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/data_types.html#id66445.

What is the difference between atoms and DU cases without annotated data?

Atom is represent as value it self, for example atom is 'request' is just request is not string is atom. It should be differentiate from other variables, in Erlang should start by lower case or '.
Let's imagine we have atom in F# and we decide atoms in F# should start with one single quote like 'atom.
The reall example can be in pattern matching like :
let receive request =
match request with
| 'remove, Value -> action()
| 'add, Value -> action()
The atom 'remove is static, the variable request is tuple if atom and another data value type.
DU defines data by data value types, atoms are valueless in this sense.
I hope this helps you, if no I will try explain again, I don't know your level of Erlang :)

I meant, in what is it diffent from a DU like:
type RequestType = Remove | Add
let receive request =
match request with
| Remove, value -> action()
| Add, value -> anotherAction()
in this case the DU RequestType is reeally either Remove or Add but both cases have no value associated with them. The "Remove" or "Add" are the values themselves.

Daniel, your approach is right! I really cannot argue, you convinced me I don't need atoms in pattern matching also I see advantage when I upgrade RequestType compiler will push me to update my code. You see that's why I love F# I learn new thing every day.
