if code is self documenting, adding comments later for API purposes gets in the way of readability. Padding out with comments also gets in the way of a well crafted level of code density. Therefore it'd be nice to be able to comment functions in supporting files, and to have a mechanism for VS / F# to both maintain these links, and link to the relevant information for intenseness purposes.
Additionally, a transitive, find inherited comment would be quite useful too. VS could have a InheritedIntellisense tag.
Perhaps a code merge as a part of the build process would suffice.
The idea of sprinkling comments in code for automatic document generation, although useful, seems back-to-front for an actively maintained code base (assuming good tooling support). It'd be nice to separate things out and to have things flowing in the reverse direction too.

Have you looked into F# signature files? These allow you to have your API comments in a separate file from your implementation, just as you described.
