A common task in .NET is to implement is IDisposable.
I find the most common task is implementing IDisposable on a class that have fields that are subclasses of IDisposable and no unmanaged resources.
Implementing IDisposable is tedious and error prone. F# supports use on local bindings. Why not support it for member bindings as well?

Thanks for the suggestion. it’s definitely an interesting one and it took me a long time to decline it. I’ve listed the reasons below. It is possible we might reconsider this at some point, but for now marking it declined as I don’t think we can proceed with it in the language as things stand

The title should read: Allow use on member bindings.
Not sure if I can update it.

There's different ways of implementing IDisposable, it's not immediately clear what use on a member binding would do.

After consideration my belief is that this is too hard for F#, because of the reasons discussed in the PRs below: implementing disposal is best done explicitly. Also, when you consider things like the IAsyncDisposable pattern then I don't think it's necessarily the right thing to continue to hardwire F# as a language to the very imperative Dispose pattern.
