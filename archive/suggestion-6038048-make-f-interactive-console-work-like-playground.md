it would be great to make F# script interactive-console really interactive like the Apple new Xcode 6 playground. Also support color and graphic. Which will shorten the feed back loop in development.

This uservoice is for the F# language and core library design.
This feature seems more appropriate for one of the F# IDE tooling projects â€“ either the Visual F# Power Tools, or the Xamarin tools for F#, or the FsLab project.
Closing for now as the suggestion is about tooling, not language or library. The suggestion itself is very worthwhile.
