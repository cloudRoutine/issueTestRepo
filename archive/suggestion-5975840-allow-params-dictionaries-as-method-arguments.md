When interoperating with languages that are more dynamic than F# (like Python, Matlab or R), we can often get the list of available methods/functions, but we cannot always get the names and types of parameters. For example, in R provider, you sometimes have to write:
namedParams [ ("xval", days), ("yval", prices), ("another", box 1) ]
|> R.plot
It would be nice if I could put the "Params" attribute on a "IDictionary<string, 'T>" and let the compiler provide all additional named parameters as a dictionary:
R.plot(xval=days, yval=prices, another=1)
This would have other uses - for example, when creating a Deedle data frame, you need to specify names of columns. We have a custom operator and function for that:
frame [ "prices" => prices; "days" => days ]
But with the new feature, we could let you write, for example:
Frame.ofColumns(prices = [...], days, = [...])
This could really be done just by adding [Params] attribute to an IDicitionary parameter. To support the R provider case, this needs to work in type providers too.

Updating to planned to indicate this is approved in general terms. A detailed design and implementation would be needed.
Implementations of approved language design can now be submitted as pull requests to the appropriate branch of http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp. See http://fsharp.github.io/2014/06/18/fsharp-contributions.html for information on contributing to the F# language and core library.

Just for a reference, I imagine that the definition would look like this:
type R =
static member plot([<Params>] args:IDictionary<string, obj>) = (...)
I suppose one subtle thing here is to make sure that the type information propagates correctly through the type inference - so when you define it as taking `obj`, the arguments will need to be boxed, but when you define the dictionary as containing just `float` values, the optional arguments would presumably be restricted to floats.

It also should be noted that IDictionary does not have an ordering while the arguments do. It would be ideal to capture this information.

I'm generally in favour of addressing this for F# 4.0, if a technically feasible design is proposed, analyzed in detail, and an implementation+testing provided by the F# Community.
To get more concrete, what's being proposed is presumably a new attribute ParamDictionary used like this:
open System
open System.Collections.Generic
open System.Runtime.CompilerServices
type C() =
static member DoSomething1([<ParamArray>] args: 'T[]) = ()
static member DoSomething2([<ParamDictionary>] args: IDictionary<string,obj>) = ()
C.DoSomething2(arg1=1, arg2=3)
Is that correct?
Implementing this is non-trivial (Tomas mentions some reasons why) and libraries would pick up a dependency on the updated FSharp.Core containing the attribute.

I don't know about the user-facing side of things (i.e., how to expose this in the language), but on the compiled side of things, you could represent this using the usual [<ParamArray>] attribute with a KeyValuePair<string,obj>[]-typed parameter. That would avoid the need for consuming code to take a dependency on FSharp.Core and it would preserve parameter ordering (as Rick mentioned). Although this doesn't actually use IDictionary<_,_>, it doesn't seem likely that most real-world uses are going to pass in more than, say, 20-30 arguments, so lookups can use a linear scan of the argument array to find a matching k-v pair without too much performance overhead.

Another way to implement this (besides what I mentioned below) would be to have a [<ParamDictionary>] attribute and have the F# compiler compile that parameter into an ExpandoObject. That would interop a bit more closely with C# dynamic and the DLR, but the price is that it wouldn't work if targeting a .NET Framework earlier than 4.0.
