Essentially it would let you add a name to specific set of values in a record. and reuse that set when initializing something to a specific state or configuration.
It would look something like this:
type Permissions = { clientServices: bool ; ManagesUsers:bool; InternalContact:bool;}
|ProjectManager = {clientServices = true; ManagesUsers = false; IneralContact:true; }
|Administrator = {clientServices = false; ManagesUsers = true; IneralContact:false; }
|Recruiter = {ClientServices = false; ManagesUsers= true; InternalContact:true;}
type User = {FirstName :string; LastName; permissions:Permissions; }
let Stevo = {FirstName = "Stephen"; LastName = "Rogers"; permissions = Permissions.ProjectManager }

How is this different from defining values in a module? Definition and usage would be almost unchanged. E.g.
type Permissions = { clientServices: bool ; ManagesUsers:bool; InternalContact:bool;}
module Permissions =
projectManager = {clientServices = true; ManagesUsers = false; InternalContact:true; }
administrator = {clientServices = false; ManagesUsers = true; InternalContact:false; }
recruiter = {clientServices = false; ManagesUsers= true; InternalContact:true;}
type User = {FirstName :string; LastName; permissions:Permissions; }
let Stevo = {FirstName = "Stephen"; LastName = "Rogers"; permissions = Permissions.projectManager }

Sure it's something more concise that
type Permissions = { clientServices: bool ; ManagesUsers:bool; InternalContact:bool;} with
static member ProjectManager = {clientServices = true; ManagesUsers = false; InternalContact=true; }
static member Administrator = {clientServices = false; ManagesUsers = true; InternalContact=false; }
static member Recruiter = {clientServices = false; ManagesUsers= true; InternalContact=true;}
So why this extended syntax?

Agree with Max and exercitus vir - no need for this, just use let bindings in a module.

There are a number of proposals aroundn to extend the support for records in F# in ways that can fairly easily be programmed today by using either
(a) object members on record types; or
(b) a module of functionality related to the record type; or
(c) an object type instead of a record type
All seem sufficiently good solutions and more general. Because of this, I agree with the comments below.
