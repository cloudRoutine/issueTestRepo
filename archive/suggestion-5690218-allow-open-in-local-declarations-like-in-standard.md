I like this, though I don't know what the downsides might be.

I don't think there are any downsides to this. An "open Module" declaration has no run-time effects nor does it generate new types so there are no major semantic issues to worry about. It merely allows finer grained scoping of existing bindings.

A prototype is available here.

Paul, could you please bring the PR across to http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp? It is of definite interest (though no commitment about including the feature as yet)
