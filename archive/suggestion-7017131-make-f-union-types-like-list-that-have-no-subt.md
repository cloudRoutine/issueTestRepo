The compiled form of the "list" type in F# uses a single class. This is also the case for some other F# union types, e.g. ones which are enumerations where no case carries any data. For these types, the compiled representation of the union type should be marked "sealed" in F# metadata
This is a breaking change w.r.t. hypothetical clients in other .NET languages that take advantage of this, though we know of no such instance in practice.

Considering this approved for F# 4.x or the first possible update after this.
Discussion still very welcome.
Implementations of approved language design items can now be submitted as pull requests to the appropriate branch of http://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp. See http://fsharp.github.io/2014/06/18/fsharp-contributions.html for information on contributing to the F# language and core library.
