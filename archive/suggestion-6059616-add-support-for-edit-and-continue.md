F# doesn't support Edit and Continue which has been a part of Visual Studio since 1998 (for C++), and 2005 (for C#). While FSI and the REPL reduce the need for it, this can become awkward when working with large numerical data sets which aren't readily available outside of the host program.

This is a suggestion for the Visual F# Tools, rather than the F# language. Suggestions for the Visual F# Tools go to a different user voice. See http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2315271--edit-and-continue-feature-for-f
