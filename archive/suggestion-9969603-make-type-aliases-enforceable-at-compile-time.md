[<Measure>] is enforced by the compiler, but adds no performance overhead and causes no issues for interop.
It would be nice to have a similar attribute that could be applied to any type.

so you basically propose something like Haskell's newtype?

We decided against this in F# 1.0
If we make a change here, it would be to implement single-case union types using structs, e.g.
[<Struct>]
type X = X of int
This will be just as performant as a "int" value and the type gets a proper new nominal type for reflection and other purposes.
Another factor is the set of members the type would support - when you think of the .NET representation, you can you define new members on the struct type, but not on a type alias.
