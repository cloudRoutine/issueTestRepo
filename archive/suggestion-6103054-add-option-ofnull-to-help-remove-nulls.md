Many APIs and types support the use of null. To help remove null and promote the use of option, It would be good to add a standard function that can be used to wrap nullable types.
May be something like:
type Option<'A> with
static member ofNull (t:'T when 'T : null) = function
| null -> None
| x -> Some x

Or just:
type Option<'A> with
static member ofNull (t:'T when 'T : null) =
if t = null then None else Some t

or call it Option.ofObj

Perhaps the name isn't perfect, but I fully support the elimination of nulls by wrapping them.
Other names suggested, indicating its use outside Option<'A>: "deNull, tryNull, nullToOption, toOption"

I think it's not very productive to add one function at a time. Someone made a PR that contained only single function (Option.filter).
I suggest to pull all useful functions from here https://github.com/jack-pappas/ExtCore/blob/master/ExtCore/Pervasive.fs#L705 and here https://github.com/fsprojects/fsharpx/blob/master/src/FSharpx.Core/ComputationExpressions/Monad.fs#L84, discuss the list and add them all at once, including the tests.

Integrating ExtCore would be nice, it's very well thought out and optimised.

Mapping between Nullable<T> and Option<T> would also be useful.

I have submitted a PR with names Option.ofObj and Option.toObj, see https://visualfsharp.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/dsyme/cleanup/contribution/7672

Excellent idea.
Also Option.ofNullable for mapping System.Nullable<T> into F# Option types and converse operations Option.toObj and Option.toNullable to map options to reference and value types, respectively.
