See https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/229
Some declaration constructs allow attributes on the same line as the keyword for the declaration, e.g.
[<Measure>] type kg
[<Measure>] type m
However this doesn't work for "let" bindings, e.g.

Right now the consistent way to do things is always to use multiple lines, e.g.https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/445888/6168957/07eb7688-b2ca-11e4-887e-97e8de7c90c9.png.
The suggestion is to make this consistent by allowing single-line use everywhere, if that is technically possible.

Closing as this idea (listed by me) as it has little support
